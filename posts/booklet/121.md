#  Deploy Proxmox virtual machines using Cloud-init

Due to performance problems with my ESXI homelab I decided to give the open source solution [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/) a try. One of my goals was to install all my virtual machines with the [Cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) solution. With Cloud-init it is possible to inject informations such as ssh keys, network information or user profiles in an standarized way at boot time. The benefit of using Cloud-init is the pre-provisioning of necessary configuration items such as a static ip address or a default user with activated ssh public key authentication. Furthermore, this kind of provisioning helps a lot for further automation steps with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) or even complete CI/CD pipelines in Gitlab, Jenkins etc. But first, let's start with the VM provisioning steps in Proxmox.

## Location of Cloud-Init images

Nowadays, nearly all big Linux distributions offer ready to use Cloud-init images. Here is a short list of mirrors where you can choose the distribution that fits your needs:

## Create your template

### Download the image on your Proxmox server (I'm using Ubuntu for my VMs)

```
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/bionic/current/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
```

### Define your virtual machine which you're like to use as a template

```
qm create 9000 --name "ubuntu-1804-cloudinit-template" --memory 2048 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0
```

With this command you have created a new virtual machine with the id 9000 (has to be unique in the Proxmox ecosystem), 2 gigabyte of ram and a bridge network using the virtio controller.

### (Important for Ubuntu!) Rename your image suffix

```
mv bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.qcow2
```

I don't know why, but if import the disk image using the *.img suffix, Proxmox is unable to boot from this image. I have to open a bug report for that.

### Import the disk image in the local Proxmox storage

```
qm importdisk 9000 bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.qcow2 local-lvm
```

The commandline utility uploads the image in the local Proxmox storage and assigns a unique name (for the virtual machine with the id 9000) to it. In this case we're getting the name "vm-9000-disk-0".

### Configure your virtual machine to use the uploaded image

```
qm set 9000 --scsihw virtio-scsi-pci --scsi0 local-lvm:vm-9000-disk-0
```

### Adding the Cloud-init image as CD-Rom to your virtual machine

```
qm set 9000 --ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit
```

This is an important step, because it allows you to change the settings I've already mentioned before.

Cloud-Image settings in Proxmox

Do not set settings here, because we're using this virtual machine as a template. You can edit the settings after you've cloned the template for use.

### Restrict the virtual machine to boot from the Cloud-init image only

```
qm set 9000 --boot c --bootdisk scsi0
```

### Attach a serial console to the virtual machine (this is needed for some Cloud-Init distributions, such as Ubuntu)

```
qm set 9000 --serial0 socket --vga serial0
```

### Finally create a template

```
qm template 9000
```

### Create a virtual machine out of the template

With the template you can clone as many virtual machines as you like and change the Cloud-init parameters for your needs. First we have to clone the template to a new virtual machine:

```
qm clone 9000 100 --name my-virtual-machine
```

We created a new virtual machine with the unique id 100 and the name "my-virtual-machine". Now you can change the Cloud-init settings either in the admin ui or with the qm command:

```
qm set 100 --sshkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
qm set 123 --ipconfig0 ip=192.168.2.100/24,gw=192.168.2.1
```

With this command you have set a public key for SSH authentication and the static IP 192.168.2.100. We didn't set a user which means Ubuntu is using the default one (ubuntu). That's it! Your Cloud-Init image should now boot up fine with the desired settings.

## Next steps

This tutorial is just the beginning. You're now able to use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), Ansible or other automation tools to create "Infrastructure as a code" helping you to ramp up whole datacenters with just a few commands.
