![89%20d2c28fd6b78145c6b3e804b35f757216/best-free-open-source-digital-asset-management-software-banner.jpg](89%20d2c28fd6b78145c6b3e804b35f757216/best-free-open-source-digital-asset-management-software-banner.jpg)

You must have seen people working on desktops that are full of file icons. Every day they produce several digital documents that take space on their desktop. They struggle when it comes to finding a required data file. It is a common example of poorly managed content. It becomes difficult for them to organize, and then, there is a day when they no longer find space on their desktop. It comes as a revelation for them, and suddenly they realize, the need for managing and organizing their data more efficiently. They start creating folders, and then they spend hours to move all files in the designated folders.

Just imagine that when people produce such an overwhelming amount of digital data files every day, what would be the case with the organizations and businesses of the present day?

Organizations are growing big day by day, and so is the digital data that they produce. A massive amount of digital data is generated every day by them that includes; Client presentations, brand images, product images, seminar pictures, product description videos, animated brand stories, and other Docx, PDF, or Excel sheets. Such data, which is in the digital form, is required daily for bagging more business. Data is an asset for the organizations, and it can be leveraged for monetary gains if used efficiently.

For efficient use and easy access, Organizations need to manage and streamline their digital data. It comes under the asset and content management process of the businesses. The responsible Asset and Content Management theories gave birth to Digital Asset Management (DAM), a subset of Enterprise content management (ECM). The process of storing, managing, and retrieving digital assets when required, is called Digital Asset Management. Companies deploy software to achieve their goal of efficient digital asset management.

Digital Asset Management software allows storing, organizing, accessing, cataloging, and retrieving of your digital asset or content. It adds metadata to each content and searches for digital files easy. It can deliver content on multiple devices in various formats. It can integrate with other external tools and platforms to provide services like sending bulk data to external partners in a secure way.

**Need for Digital Asset Management Software**

1. Companies cannot store all the data on their servers. It will require a lot of hardware capabilities and would add an unnecessary cost to the company.
2. Even if companies deploy hardware to store data, it is not feasible to keep a back-up for such a vast amount of data files.
3. In the world of cyber-attacks, it is difficult for companies to keep the data safe and secure. The digital asset management solution providers possess the expertise and quality compliance that companies don't have.
4. It is not easy for companies to send a bulk amount of data to external partners without deploying digital asset management software.
5. Companies might not want to share or provide access to all content to external partners. Digital asset management software can create a separate portal for different external partners. It can restrict the access of each external partner to that specific portal only.
6. Companies can't provide bulk content to external or internal members in the customized formats. A digital asset management software has the feature to change the formats of all digital assets as required.

**Benefits of using a Digital Asset Management Software:**

1. *Digital Asset Management software manages various types of Digital content.*

2. The data is more secure and safe in the servers of [DAM software](https://www.goodfirms.co/digital-asset-management-software/) that has multiple layers of security.
