I used to have an Apple laptop as my daily driver. I could do almost everything there; development, proposal writing, music composition etc. But the fear of vendor lock-in, the concern that I am depended on Apple’s whims and vices — which are arguably very expensive — led me to seek a new solution.

I started building a machine learning workstation; a great CPU, lots of RAM and a competent GPU, among others. My OS of choice for almost anything was Ubuntu, except I needed Microsoft Office for proposal writing. Office online is just not there yet and, let’s face it, LibreOffice is a disaster. So, the solution was to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows 10. The freedom you experience moving from Apple to Ubuntu is unparalleled, and the options you have building your own PC are almost infinite.

Dual boot was the answer for a long time. One million of context switches later, WSL came. Thus, I started moving a portion of my workflow to Windows. But still, there were many things missing. However, **WSL 2 seems to be a game-changer.** **In this story, I will show you how to move your development workflow to Windows 10 and WSL 2, its new features and what to expect in the near future.**
