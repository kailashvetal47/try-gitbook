For developers, there is a lot you can do with Cozy. You can create a connector or you can build a complete Cozy app, and our documentation can help you to get started. If you need a helping hand with your Cozy hacking and coding endeavors, you are welcome to apply for our mentorship program.

## Discuss

If you have questions about installing, using, and troubleshooting Cozy, head over to the forums or join our IRC channel. Here, you can talk to other users and Cozy's developers in real-time. Also, feel free to mention us on Twitter and get in touch with us there.

## Submit Feedback

Your feedback is invaluable to us. How do you use Cozy? What features do you like? Which functionality is lacking? What can we do to improve Cozy? We encourage you to submit your feedback via our forums. GitHub users and developers can also submit bug reports and pull requests via Github.

## Translate Cozy

Translating Cozy into your language and improving existing translations is another useful way to contribute to the project. And the Transifex service provides a convenient and friendly way to localize Cozy.

## Meet us in person

We regularly organize meetups in different cities, which provide a great opportunity to meet Cozy developers and users in person. Our meetups are social events where we discuss all things Cozy and have fun in the process. We also give away Cozy Cloud goodies, so attending a meetup gives you a chance to get your hands on Cozy Cloud stickers, mugs, and T-shirts.
