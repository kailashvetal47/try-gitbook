#  Microsoft and Open Source- An unofficial timeline
![76%20d0c7053c444547b99957cd8232eab95f/microsoft-love-linux-19282.768x432.jpg](76%20d0c7053c444547b99957cd8232eab95f/microsoft-love-linux-19282.768x432.jpg)

The profound cultural shift towards open source did at Microsoft was the result of sustained efforts within the company by open source advocates. Microsoft's shift is a model for positively transforming organizations. It is also a testament to the power of collaboration in technology. After Build 2020 it is now clear Microsoft is a Linux and open source company.

This is a very brief timeline of Microsoft's evolution into an open source leader. It is an attempt to provide historical context of a two-decades-long process. An open source version of this post is [maintained on GitHub](https://github.com/sirredbeard/microsoft-opensource).
