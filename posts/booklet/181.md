#  Small and Simple DDNS Client -
![profile.jpg](181%2052ad8349c2d34cad8dc473a3f3f5b74c/profile.jpg)

In-a-dyn is a small and simple Dynamic DNS, [DDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS), client with HTTPS support. It is commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions, used in off-the-shelf routers and Internet gateways to automate the task of keeping your DNS record up to date with any IP address changes from your [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP). It can also be used in installations with redundant (backup) connections to the Internet.

## Supported Providers

The following is a curated list of *some* of the natively supported DDNS providers. Other providers, e.g. [http://twoDNS.de](http://twodns.de/), can usually be supported using the custom provider support. For the full details, see the [README](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn/blob/master/README.md), or `inadyn.conf(5)` found in the tarball.

Some of these services are free of charge for non-commercial use, others take a small fee, but also provide more domains to choose from.

## Example

The configuration file on most systems is in `/etc/inadyn.conf`:

```
# In-A-Dyn v2.0 configuration file format
period = 300

# The FreeDNS username must be in lower case and
# the password (max 16 chars) is case sensitive
provider freedns.afraid.org {
    username = lower-case-username
    password = case-sensitive-pwd
    hostname = some.example.com
}

```

In-a-dyn comes with a systemd unit file, so simply restart the service or send `SIGHUP` to an already running inadyn to make it reload the `.conf` file. If youâ€™ve built Inadyn yourself from source, the `.conf` file may be located elsewhere. See the `-prefix` argument to the `configure` script, use `-help` or see the [README](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn/blob/master/README.md) for details on building.

More examples in the `inadyn.conf(5)` man page and the [README](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn/blob/master/README.md).

**Note:** The `.conf` file format syntax changed in v2.0!

## Origin & References

This is the continuation of the [original INADYN](http://www.inatech.eu/inadyn/) project by Narcis Ilisei. The goal of this project is to focus on *BSD and various embedded Linux platforms, but *Cygwin is also supported*. All sane patches addressing this target audience are welcome!

Relevant patches and features from the following forks have been merged:

The [inadyn-mt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/inadyn-mt/) project is another fork from the original INADYN. It maintains support for Windows and adds many new features and fixes, not just for Windows.
