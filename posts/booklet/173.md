#  Stop laptop going to sleep when closing the lid (UBUNTU Server) - Dell Community
I had the same issue with non-desktop Debian installation running on an Inspiron laptop. As soon as I shut the lid, the system would suspend/hibernate instead of continuing to run. After spending time going through all of the BIOS Setup settings and not finding an option to disable the "lid closed" event, the following Linux configuration change worked for me:

[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/200125/debian-8-jessie-laptop-stops-working-after-closing-t...](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/200125/debian-8-jessie-laptop-stops-working-after-closing-the-laptop-lid)

If you're not logged in as root, you'll need to add "sudo " to invoke the editor as in:

```
sudo nanoÂ /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

In the file above, I changed only this line:

```
#HandleLidSwitch=suspend
```

to this:

```
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
```

After saving the file, I ran:

```
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```

This immediately resolved the problem.

Here is some additional background on these configuration options:

I don't think the syntax above is different for Ubuntu but if you encounter any issues, review the following post:

I hope this helps.
