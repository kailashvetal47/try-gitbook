#  Developer Workstations with Proxmox VE and X11 - Proxmox VE
Proxmox VE is primarily used as virtualization platform with NO additional software installed. In some case it makes sense to have a full desktop running on Proxmox VE, for example for developers using Proxmox VE as their primary workstation/desktop.

Installing additional packages could lead to a hardly upgradeable system and is not supported from the Proxmox support team and therefore only for expert use.

## Install a standard Proxmox VE system

Just install the standard Proxmox VE, following this guide: [Installation](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Installation)

Custom installations: [Install Proxmox VE on Debian Buster](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Install_Proxmox_VE_on_Debian_Buster)

## Install X-windows

Update your repository and system by running:

```
apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade

```

I choose xfce4 desktop as this a lightweight desktop environment. If you prefer another one, just replace xfce4 with lxde, gnome, icewm, kde, ...

```
apt-get install xfce4 chromium lightdm

```

## Start X-windows

Before starting the x-windows, create a normal user with:

```
# adduser newusername

```

Start the login manager:

```
systemctl start lightdm

```

or just reboot.

## Optional: Linux Mint Mate Desktop

Install Proxmox VE as described above.

install from Debian repository.

```
apt-get install mate

```

## Optional: NVidia Drivers

```
# tested proxmox 5.3

```

```
# nouveau was faulting system. blacklist or unload driver 
# lspci -k |grep VGA
# add 0000: to unbind driver.
# echo "0000:24:00.0" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nouveau/unbind

```

```
# blacklist 
echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

```

```
