#  ThinStation by Donald A. Cupp Jr. - Linux RDP
**ThinStation** is a basic and small, yet very powerful, Open Source [thin client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client) operating system supporting all major connectivity protocols: *[Citrix](http://citrix.com/)* ICA, *[Redhat](http://www.spice-space.org/)* Spice, *[NoMachine](http://nomachine.com/)* NX, *[2X](http://2x.com/)* ThinClient, *[Microsoft](http://microsoft.com/)* Windows terminal services (RDP, via RDesktop/FreeRDP), *[VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/products/horizon-view)* Horizon View, *[Cendio](http://cendio.com/)* ThinLinc, [Tarantella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantella,_Inc), [X](http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/), [telnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet), [tn5250](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tn5250), [VMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) terminal and [SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (No special configuration of the application servers is needed to use ThinStation).

**ThinStation** is mainly intended for schoolroom, office, company or department use, but can be used at home (eg. for a silent PC in the bedroom that 'runs' XP on your workstation in the back room).

While **ThinStation** is based on Linux, users may actually never see Linux at all. If you decide to connect directly to a Microsoft Windows, Citrix or Unix server, the user will feel that they are running directly on the server. But, you can also have a local Desktop interface (with a local Browser & other tools).

**ThinStation** supports a *Microsoft* Windows-only environment and REQUIRES NO UNIX/Linux KNOWLEDGE.

**ThinStation** runs on ordinary PC hardware (64 bit i686 class). You may either reuse older computers or save a lot of time on workstation administration. Or both! An old Pentium-II with 128 MB RAM or better can be a perfectly useful workstation. And you don't need a hard disk - you can boot off the network and even have a silent workstation. Workstation devices (floppy/HD/CD/USB) and printers (LPT/USB) are supported.

**ThinStation** can be booted from network (e.g. diskless) using Etherboot/PXE or from a local floppy/CD/HD/flash-disk, and prebuilt images and a Live CD are available. The thin client configuration can be local or centralized to simplify management.

The latest stable release is [version 6.2.6.](http://sourceforge.net/projects/thinstation/files/thinstation/thinstation-6/) Please be aware that not all docs have been updated yet, but all basic concepts apply. As of version 6.0, we only support 64bit
