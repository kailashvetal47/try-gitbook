## A few words about Terraform

If you have read my last [blog post](https://norocketscience.at/deploy-proxmox-virtual-machines-using-cloud-init/) you already know how to create templates for further provisioning using the Cloud-Init specification. In this post I like to show you how you easily deploy your infrastructure using Terraform on the virtualisation solution Proxmox. First of all, what is Terraform exactly? Terraform is a so called "Infrastructure as a code" software developed by [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) - a company which also created [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and other famous tools for professional cloud solutions. According to [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-infrastructure-as-code),

> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code.

What's the benefit you may ask. One of the biggest advantages is that you don't have to install your servers and other components manually. Instead, with just a few lines of code you're able to manage your complete infrastructure. This automation step brings your stability, quality improvements, resilience and time for more important things. Furthermore, you have the possibility to integrate your Terraform configuration into your existing VCS and automatically run changes through your infrastructure with a proper CI/CD pipeline.

Another good question - why use Terraform if you've already have Ansible in place? Have you ever tried to remove a package in Ansible? If you just remove it from you playbook configuration it is still on your server until you write the right configuration (the attribute "absent" is your friend) or remove it manualy. Terraform takes care on this changes and has a clever dependency management for "First this, then that" decisions. Writing about the differences between the two would hijack my "Terraform practicing" article, so to keep a long story short:

- Use Terraform for all your infrastructure stuff (VMs and the baseline software on it)
- Use Ansible for the configuration management (Installation of Applications and the configuration of it)

## Let's start with practicing

### Assumptions

- You have already a Proxmox server installed (it works with other virtualisation and cloud providers too - but this article is about Proxmox and Terraform)
- You have already OS-templates with Cloud-init defined (if not, please read my [blog post](https://norocketscience.at/deploy-proxmox-virtual-machines-using-cloud-init/) about it)

### 1. Installation of Terraform

You can install Terraform on the major plattforms using either the package manager/app store from the chosen system or download the binaries from [Hashicorp](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) directly. On OSX I used [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which is a package manager for OSX.

```
brew install terraform
```

After the installation let's check the Version of your Terraform Version. Please use Version 12.x upwards, because there have been many changes between 11.x and 12.x

```
terraform version
```

### 2. Installation of the Terraform Proxmox provider

The Proxmox provider is not a default one - a so called 3rd party provider. Thus, it's necessary to install it manually. As prerequisite you have to install the Golang progamming language on your system. Golang is available on all major [plattforms](https://golang.org/dl/). For the installation I used Homebrew again.

```
brew install go
```

With Go installed you're able to compile the provider using the commands

```
go get github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/cmd/terraform-provider-proxmox
go get github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/cmd/terraform-provisioner-proxmox

sudo cp $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-proxmox ~/.terraform.d/plugins
sudo cp $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provisioner-proxmox ~/.terraform.d/plugins
```

### 3. Configure your first Terraform project

We have installed the Terraform software in step 1 and the necessary Proxmox provider in step 2. Now we're going to configure our first Terraform infrastructure which runs on Proxmox. In my example, I like to install a small Kubernetes infrastructure which should run [K3s (a lightweight Kubernetes distribution)](https://k3s.io/) later on. For that we have to define the following environment:

- 1 x Master Server
- 2 x Node Server
- 1 x Storage Server (for persistent storage)

### Configure the Proxmox provider

First, we configure the connection settings for the Proxmox provider. For better readability of our infrastructure code, we split variables and provider in two different configuration files named "variables.tf" and "provider.tf"

`variable "pm_api_url" { default = "https://"ip of your proxmox server":8006/api2/json"
}
variable "pm_user" {
default = "root@pam"
}
variable "pm_password" {
default = "3277db3c"
}`variables.tf

`provider "proxmox" { pm_parallel = 1 pm_tls_insecure = true pm_api_url = var.pm_api_url pm_password = var.pm_password pm_user = var.pm_user
}`provider.tf

### Configure the virtual machines

Next step is the main configuration of our k3s-cluster server. Here you have to adapt the following attributes according to your configuration:

- target_node (the name of your Proxmox instance)
- name (the name of the virtual server)
- clone (the name of the template in Proxmox)
- cores
- memory
- storage (the right storage pool in Proxmox)
- ipconfig0 (Use the right IP range for your servers - the count.index is necessary if you have more then one server configured - like the k3s_agents in the example below)

The "ignore changes" lifecycle block is necessary, because Terraform likes to change the mac address on the second run - maybe a problem in the Proxmox provider - see here: [https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/112](https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/112)

`resource "proxmox_vm_qemu" "k3s_server" { count = 1 name = "kubernetes-master-${count.index}" target_node = "homelab" clone = "ubuntu-1804LTS-template" os_type = "cloud-init" cores = 4 sockets = "1" cpu = "host" memory = 1024 scsihw = "virtio-scsi-pci" bootdisk = "scsi0" disk { id = 0 size = 20 type = "scsi" storage = "data2" storage_type = "lvm" iothread = true } network { id = 0 model = "virtio" bridge = "vmbr0" } lifecycle { ignore_changes = [ network, ] } # Cloud Init Settings ipconfig0 = "ip=192.168.2.11${count.index + 1}/24,gw=192.168.2.1" sshkeys = <<EOF ${var.ssh_key} EOF
}
resource "proxmox_vm_qemu" "k3s_agent" { count = 2 name = "kubernetes-node-${count.index}" target_node = "homelab" clone = "ubuntu-1804LTS-template" os_type = "cloud-init" cores = 4 sockets = "1" cpu = "host" memory = 1024 scsihw = "virtio-scsi-pci" bootdisk = "scsi0" disk { id = 0 size = 20 type = "scsi" storage = "data2" storage_type = "lvm" iothread = true } network { id = 0 model = "virtio" bridge = "vmbr0" } lifecycle { ignore_changes = [ network, ] } # Cloud Init Settings ipconfig0 = "ip=192.168.2.12${count.index + 1}/24,gw=192.168.2.1" sshkeys = <<EOF ${var.ssh_key} EOF
}
resource "proxmox_vm_qemu" "storage" { count = 1 name = "storage-node-${count.index}" target_node = "homelab" clone = "ubuntu-1804LTS-template" os_type = "cloud-init" cores = 4 sockets = "1" cpu = "host" memory = 1024 scsihw = "virtio-scsi-pci" bootdisk = "scsi0" disk { id = 0 size = 20 type = "scsi" storage = "data2" storage_type = "lvm" iothread = true } network { id = 0 model = "virtio" bridge = "vmbr0" } lifecycle { ignore_changes = [ network, ] } # Cloud Init Settings ipconfig0 = "ip=192.168.2.13${count.index + 1}/24,gw=192.168.2.1" sshkeys = <<EOF ${var.ssh_key} EOF
}`main.tf

### Add ssh-pubkey for Cloud-Init

To get passwordless login (useful for tools like Ansible), create a variable with your ssh_key in the variables.tf file.

`variable "ssh_key" { default = "ssh-rsa ..."
}`variables.tf

### Deployment Time

Terraform has a simple but powerful deployment cycle, which consists of the following steps:

- Init - Initializes the Terraform project and install needed plugins, dependencies...
- Validate - Validates the syntax of the created Terraform .tf files
- Plan - Calculates the steps and changes to install/upgrade your infrastructure
- Apply - Applies the changes on the configured systems

If you try to skip a step for example start with terraform plan, Terraform inform you to initialize the project first:

```
Error: Could not satisfy plugin requirements

Plugin reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".

Plugins are external binaries that Terraform uses to access and manipulate
resources. The configuration provided requires plugins which can't be located,
don't satisfy the version constraints, or are otherwise incompatible.

Terraform automatically discovers provider requirements from your
configuration, including providers used in child modules. To see the
requirements and constraints from each module, run "terraform providers".

Error: provider.proxmox: new or changed plugin executable
```

So let's start with the initialization first.

```
terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

```

And Terraform informs you about the next step. But instead we like to check if our configuration ist correct:

```
terraform validate

Success! The configuration is valid.
```

Seems we did a good job during our configuration. Now it's the time to see what Terraform likes to deploy:

```
terraform plan

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plan was saved to: planfile

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "planfile"
```

As you can see - Terraform likes to install 4 new server. It also shows us the detailed configuration. The configuration can be read like a "diff" file:

- **+** means add
- **-** means remove
- **~** means replaced

The file "planfile" can be used for the next apply command:

```
terraform apply planfile

Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.

State path: terraform.tfstate

Depending on your hardware this needs some time. If everything runs fine you can see the output above. Terraform successfully created 4 new ressources, which you can use for install the K3s cluster. Because we don't like to install anything manually we will use Ansible for this job.

But this is another story I have to tell ;-)

Wish all of you a happy new year!
