#  10 Places for Creative People to Build, Innovate and Invent
Makerspaces are collaborative work areas with tools and equipment where people interested in innovation and invention can come together to design, build, create, and engineer. It is open to all, irrespective of age, educational qualifications or gender.

Maker culture in India is still a relatively new concept, with just below 20 makerspaces opened up in a few cities across the country. Makerspaces, or DIY spaces, are places where people with an interest in science, technology, engineering, robotics, mechanics, innovation, invention and creativity, gather to put all their ideas into action. It is open to all, irrespective of age, educational qualifications or gender.

A makerspace is where you go if you have ideas but not the necessary resources, tools, equipment, physical space and technical advice to turn that idea into a physical product. It’s also where you design your own prototypes, have fun, interact with other people who think like you, and even make an Iron Man suit for the next cosplay.

Usually, makerspaces are equipped with 3D printers and other such large machines that one cannot afford as an individual. They also provide training on the use and possibilities of these equipment. Check out these makerspaces, open to all, in these cities:
