# Docker + VS

The Docker extension for VS Code makes it easy to build, run, manage, and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code. To start using it, make sure to [download the extension for the Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker). Moreover, this is an open-source project so you can inspect its code and the installation procedure is pretty straightforward, so there is no need to cover it here in a different section.

In this section, we cover the highlight features of the Docker extension. Later, we use many of them in a simple example.

- **Edit your Dockerfiles:** You can use IntelliSense auto-complete feature when editing your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files. Furthermore, you get syntax help for common commands.

- **Genere Dockerfiles:** You can generate and add a Dockerfile to your workspace by using `Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace` command from the command palette. The command will generate both`Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` files and add them to your workspace. You can also use this command to generate Docker Compose files added as well. This will prove to be handy when debugging.

- **Explore:** The Docker extension contributes a Docker view to VS Code. The Docker view lets you examine and manage Docker assets: containers, images, volumes, networks, and container registries. Everything is just a right-click away.

- **Execute Docker commands:** Many of the most common Docker commands are built right into the Command Palette. You can run Docker commands to manage [images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image/), [networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network/), [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume/), [image registries](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/). In addition, the **`Docker: Prune System`** command will remove stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks and volumes.

Common Docker commands integrated into the palette

- **Debug containers:** Using the Docker extension we can debug services built using Node.js, Python, or .NET (C#) that are running inside a container.

There are many more features, such as registry connections and context management, but you can go a long way just by using these key offerings. Next, we implement a simple Python Flask application, dockerize it and deploy it without ever having to fiddle with the Docker CLI.

In this section, we build a simple “*Hello World*” Flask application and deploy it using the Docker extension. First, the code:

If you are familiar with Flask, you can see that this is the simplest application you can implement. It just returns “*Hello World*” whenever you hit the root endpoint. Next, we need a `requirements.txt` file to hold the dependencies and we are ready to go:

```
Flask==1.1.2
gunicorn
```

To create a Dockerfile and everything else you need just run `Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace` in the command palette (`ctlr+shift+p` in windows).

Select the `Python: Flask` option for the first question and then, the extension will ask you if you would like to include the optional Docker compose files. Choose yes; this way you will be able to debug the application running inside the container later. Finally, choose the python file holding the Flask application (the code provided above) and the port you would like to expose (`5000` is the default). You are ready!

Now, to build the image, right-click on the generated Dockerfile and choose `Build Image...`. A terminal will open and your image will be ready in a matter of seconds.

To run the application, select the Docker icon from the left panel, locate your image in the `Images` section, right-click it and choose run. That simple.

Run your container using Docker extension for VS Code

In the `Containers` section locate the running container, right-click it and choose `View Logs`. This command will display the logs of your container in the terminal. Get the endpoint that it is listening to (should be `[http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000/)`). To get the results of your Python service run `curl [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000/)`.

That’s it! The Docker extension for VS Code simplifies the process and you get back the time to concentrate on your code.

To configure debugging with Gunicorn we need something more. `The Docker: Python-Flask` launch configuration that was automatically created overrides the Gunicorn entry point of the container with the Python debugger. To debug our application running with Gunicorn we should follow the steps below:

1. Add `debugpy` to your `requirements.txt` file.
2. Add the following code snippet to the file that you wish to debug:

```
import debugpy
debugpy.listen(("0.0.0.0", 5678))
debugpy.wait_for_client()
```

3. Add a `Python: Remote Attach` configuration to `launch.json` in the `.vscode` folder. The JSON file should now look like the one below:

4. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to expose the debugger port by adding `5678:5678` to the ports section. The file should now look like the one below:

5. Start the container by right-clicking on a `docker-compose.yml` file and selecting Compose Up.

6. Set a breakpoint in the chosen file, navigate to `Run and Debug` and select the `Python: Remote Attach` launch configuration.

7. Hit F5 or press the play button to attach the debugger.

Happy debugging!

In this story, we explored the Docker extension for VS Code and how it can help us compose a Dockerfile, build an image and deploy it. To dive deeper check out the [working with containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview) topic on the Visual Studio Code documentation site to get started.
