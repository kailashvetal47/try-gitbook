#  Many teams believe they are doing Scrum, but are embracing Taylorism instead
## Scientific management vs Empirical Process Control

Cigar workers in the Ybor factory, around 1920 — from Wikipedia

Scrum is founded on Empirical Process Control, not on the Scientific Management (Taylorism).

Still, many people believe that (Scrum) teams should work more efficiently. With this, they appear to misunderstand Scrum completely.

They try to help teams to:

- increase their velocity, burning more story points over time;
- increase their predictability, meaning that they should burn the amount of story points that they planned;
- establish standard procedures to follow;
- optimize the standard procedures;
- introduce standard tooling;
- introduce standards in Scrum adoption, like same Sprint length for all teams.

> All of these obstruct a team that wishes to thrive in a complex product environment.

These rules and regulations prevent a team from truly practicing empiricism and deliver products of the highest possible value. They don’t have the opportunity to freely experiment, inspect and adapt.

What’s more: they will be pushed towards focusing on things that have nothing to do with empiricism: being predictable in generating output and showing continuous production improvement. They may even be pushed towards rigging the productivity game instead of focusing on learning and on creating value.

The leaders in a Scrum environment need to understand that Taylorism doesn’t fit in a Scrum environment. That instead they need to have a servant leader stance. Until this is the case, there’s still a lot of work cut out for the Scrum Masters among us.
