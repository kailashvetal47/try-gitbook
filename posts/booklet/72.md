#  Squash git commits when merging · devroom.io
Today I’ve been fighting to get our test suite to run against a newly delivered Oracle 12 database. Of course, that didn’t work out of the box, so there was some debugging, trial-and-error, and cursing involved. Finally, I managed to get the build back up and running. Yay!

The commit history for this pull request was horrible and some would call it *unprofessional*, looking at the various commit messages written in anger.

Normally I’d [squash all commits together using rebase](https://ariejan.net/2011/07/05/git-squash-your-latests-commits-into-one/) in the feature branch and create a nice pull request. In this case I just wanted to merge this to `develop` so the build was working. Turns out this is rather easy:

```
git checkout develop
git merge --squash fix_for_oracle_12

```

This applies all changes from the `fix_for_oracle_12` branch to your working copy, ready for you to commit in a single commit.

Done.
