#  Best Developer Communities to be part of in 2020
## Introduction:

The benefits of developer communities cannot be over-emphasized in the growth of developers from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, to mentorship, sharing support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.

Communities are usually built on shared struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and the goals of each community differ per the individual's collective needs.

Over the years, these developer communities have grown across the world with different goals and missions but still with the general aim of providing a platform for developers to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other and grow.

"If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." – African Proverb

To better help those looking out for communities to join, I have put together a list of 20 best communities in no particular order ranging from Engineering, Design, Data Science, Machine Learning, Developer Relations, Technical Writing, and more.

If you know any more communities you have found helpful, please share them in the comments section for the benefit of all :).
