[Let's talk about how I downloaded **@stationhq** this morning and have already done more work in two hours than I have in all six months **@MTV** I honestly don't know what I was doing with my life beforehand maybe just watching teen mom!!!](https://twitter.com/Terr/status/990982683114303488)

[I discovered **@stationhq** last night and loved it so much I’ve been recommending it to my team, friends, former co-workers, etc. So far everyone has absolutely loved it. It’s making my work sooooo much easier!](https://twitter.com/justinmeader/status/994610198831648768)

[If you use a computer for work and use web apps (think Google Suite, MS Office, Atlassian, etc.), please check out **@stationhq** - it has made my workflow sooo much faster & easier, and it uncluttered my browser](https://twitter.com/debschleede/status/1039863579384655872)

[Absolutely loving **@stationhq** on macOS thus far. Brings everything work related across disparate apps onto a single, tabbed window. Very responsive. UI/UX little rough on edges but shows great promise. Already a daily driver for work! **#workflow**](https://twitter.com/sanjanah/status/996877059157737473)

[As a developer I like **@stationhq** because they are developing their product with eagerness. As updates come once a week, it has improved in no time. It's my great inspiration for developing an iOS app in a short term.](https://twitter.com/curryisdrink/status/1024053297529815040)
