Open source NVIDIA GameStream client

Moonlight allows you to play your PC games on almost any device, whether you're in another room or miles away from your gaming rig.

**Moonlight** (formerly Limelight) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream protocol. We implemented the protocol used by the NVIDIA Shield and wrote a set of 3rd party clients.

You can stream your collection of PC games from your [GameStream-compatible PC](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/games/gamestream/) to any supported device and play them remotely. Moonlight is perfect for gaming on the go without sacrificing the graphics and game selection available on PC.

## Features

### Run your own cloud gaming server

You can host your own gaming server on many residential ISPs by just installing the **[Moonlight Internet Hosting Tool](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Setup-Guide#streaming-over-the-internet)** on your gaming PC.

### Multiple client platforms

If you have an Android device, iOS device, Apple TV, PC or Mac, Chromebook, PS Vita, or even a Raspberry Pi, you can use **Moonlight** to stream games to it.

### Open source

The code for our **Moonlight** clients is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/moonlight-stream) under the GPLv3 license. We welcome contributions and would be happy to help with ports to new platforms.

### Completely free

**Moonlight** is a project run by the community, not a company. We have no interest in pushing ads, bundled services, paid versions with extra features, or subscriptions.
