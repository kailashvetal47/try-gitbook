#  SSH-Copy-ID for accessing Linux Servers from Windows | MangoLassi
- 

    Okay, so I know how to do this from linux to linux, and I can view the public cert and manually copy that into my Windows Authorized keys, but that seems like a hoaky way to go about this.

    How can I setup cert access to my linux servers from my Windows workstation so I don't need to use passwords?

    Okay so figured it out with [this guide.](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToUseWindows10sBuiltinOpenSSHToAutomaticallySSHIntoARemoteLinuxMachine.aspx)

    From Windows administrative Powershell

    `ssh-keygen` `type C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh user@linuxserver 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'`

    Exit administrative Powershell

    Open Powershell

    `ssh user@linuxserver`

    Logged in.
