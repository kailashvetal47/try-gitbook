#  Database setup (Quick Start) | KeystoneJS
KeystoneJS comes with first-class GraphQL support, a highly extensible architecture, and a wonderful Admin UI

## schema => ({ GraphQL, AdminUI })

A KeystoneJS instance can be summarised as a function of your schema which creates a GraphQL API for querying, and an AdminUI for managing your data

```
keystone.createList('Todo', {  fields: {    task: { type: Text },},});keystone.createList('User', {  fields: {    name: { type: Text },    email: { type: Text },},});
```

```
createTodo(..): TodoupdateTodo(..): TododeleteTodo(..): TodocreateUser(..): UserupdateUser(..): UserdeleteUser(..): User}allTodos(..): [Todo]Todo(..): TodoallUsers(..): [User]User(..): User}id: IDtask: String}id: IDname: Stringemail: String
```
