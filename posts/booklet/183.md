How to automate your music hoarding and make it available everywhere for listening using your own damn server: 1. Search - Headphones keeps track of wanted albums and searches NZB/Private Torrents. Multiple quality download sources, and a local MusicBrainz mirror, are the keys to success. 2. Download - SAbnzbd & Transmission download the files, and send them to the processing queue. I use Transmission because of the excellent/easy Python API transmission-fluid. 3. Process - FLAC files are converted to MP3 and both are tagged with metadata by Headphones. A custom Python script manages seeding, torrents, and ratios on a per-tracker level. Beets will do a secondary pass on anything Headphones can't ID. 4. Archive - FLAC & MP3 go the NAS where they are served to clients, Beets keeps metadata and filenames in order among other tasks. 5. Listen Everywhere - LMS for synchronized whole house audio (use UPNP, Airplay, Chromecast, or a DIY Pi as clients), Plex and Airsonic for streaming/syncing to devices. Run multiple servers on one music library, use an infinite number of client apps. Why choose? 6. Analytics - I use Last.FM* to feed recommendations and new artists into Headphones database. Headphones automatically marks newly added artists as wanted - go to Step 1. Did you enjoy this diagram or info? POST A LINK TO A SPOTIFY PLAYLIST/MIXTAPE THAT YOU CURATED!!! I will listen to it and the music will be added to my archive :) * I am aware of Libre.FM, but Last.FM is the only service that does this that is almost universally supported (Spotify, browser add ons, LMS, Plex, every single client app, etc.).
