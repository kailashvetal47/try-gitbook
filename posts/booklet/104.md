#  Open Source Growth Benchmarks and the 20 Fastest-Growing OSS Startups
Venture capitalists tend to invest in fast-growing companies and often use benchmarks to categorize startups by their growth. There are plenty of battle-tested metrics for SaaS (for instance: [Scale VP](https://www.scalestudio.vc/), [Serena](https://blog.serenacapital.com/2020-european-saas-benchmark-9f7897b0988a), [OpenView](https://openviewpartners.com/expansion-saas-benchmarks/)), but nothing actionable for open-source software (OSS) yet. This article is addressing this issue.

At Runa, we invest in OSS (like [Nginx](https://runacap.com/companies/nginx/) and [MariaDB](https://runacap.com/companies/mariadb/)) and understand how a large and engaged developer community could be instrumental in building a successful enterprise software business. Thanks to Github, it is possible to assess the popularity of repositories (by ‚≠êÔ∏èstars &üç¥forks), introduce high-growth benchmarks and detect startups having the best momentum in terms of developers‚Äô attention/engagement. So let‚Äôs do it.

I used Github API to collect data on all its repositories with 1000+ stars at the beginning and the end of Q2 2020. The resulting dataset contains more than 24,000 repositories and seems sufficient to understand some of the basics of the open-source world.

Github repositories have appeared to be a winner-take-almost-all market (a typical case for the tech industry), where just a few projects grab the most of developers‚Äô attention. For instance, the top-15% repositories collected 51% of all stars in our dataset.

To understand the distribution we can plot repositories‚Äô stars sorted from the most starred repo ([freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp), ~312K stars) to 1000-star projects. The log scale helps to properly represent this dependency‚Ä¶ and it looks like a power law!

![104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/12f29RBBxw6md-MrgdMAvAg.png](104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/12f29RBBxw6md-MrgdMAvAg.png)

The blue line represents numbers of stars sorted from the largest to the smallest (actually, by repo‚Äôs star rank). It is well-approximated by a power law (the red trend line, R¬≤ = 98%): **Stars** = **900K x Star_Rank ^ (‚Äì0.649)**

Now if somebody pitches its ‚Äúoutstanding open-source traction‚Äù with ~1500 stars at the repo, some VC can answer ‚ÄúOK, but 16K+ repos did the same‚Äù (well, it could be still a very promising startup but by other reasons).

The developers‚Äô engagement is a hard metric to measure, but very roughly it could be estimated by the number of forks. Many projects with 1000+ stars do not have them ‚Äî people tend to mark them as favourites and don‚Äôt publicly play with the code by themselves. We can also see a power law here:

![104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1v3ilDpSr-2NkzO47C73ocw.png](104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1v3ilDpSr-2NkzO47C73ocw.png)

The blue line represents numbers of forks sorted from the largest to the smallest (by repo‚Äôs fork rank). It also obeys a power law for repos with 100+ forks (the red trend line, R¬≤ = 92%): **Forks = 644k x Forks_Rank ^ (-0.823)**

Accounting the limited timeline of the dataset we can use an annualised growth rate [AGR = (value now / value 1 quarter ago)‚Å¥ - 1] to show the dynamics of repositories in the year-over-year format. Unsurprisingly, the growth of stars and forks obeys the ubiquitous power law.

How can we use it to benchmark startups? Revenue growth rates usually decline at a higher revenue level (e.g. see a [dependency for SaaS](https://www.slideshare.net/bwalker33/the-mendoza-line-for-saas-growth/11?src=clipshare)) and it makes sense to compare them only within the peer group. Let‚Äôs apply the same approach for open-source popularity metrics.

I divided all considerable repositories into four quartile groups (25% of repos each) by stars and forks. They differ a lot due to a power law ‚Äî for example, the lower quartile consists of repos with 1‚Äì1.4K stars, while repos of the upper have 3.7K‚Äì 312K stars. Now we can see how growth rates change at scale:

![104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1kDqjDCdaLYE64lCocb7Meg.png](104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1kDqjDCdaLYE64lCocb7Meg.png)

The chart shows growth percentiles for stars quartiles ü§ì. In simple words ‚Äî for example, 50% of repos with 3.7K+ stars grow more than +13% per annum, and top-25% of repos with 2‚Äì3.7K stars grow more than +26%.

Unexpectedly, the median for growth increases with the number of stars, that is totally counterintuitive. For instance, usual revenue growth benchmarks have the opposite dynamics. In other words ‚Äî the more stars your repo has, the faster it grows (in %). Forks have the same issue:

![104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1YC9RNBoXJWntejIVp8Dn2g.png](104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1YC9RNBoXJWntejIVp8Dn2g.png)

The intersection of upper quartiles by stars (>3.7K) and star growth (>25%) contains the best projects‚Äî with already significant open-source traction and highest growth rates. But most of them are free community projects and do not pretend to become a $1B+ software company.

After further research I detected startups, repositories of those showed the strongest growth in Q2 2020 (a ‚Äústartup‚Äù is defined here as a product-focused commercial organisation with <$100M funding and <10 years old):

![104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1KOguMmb1JkKeR6xaifRf9Q.png](104%201c1c309b67a04c54906264d4b4bfcfea/1KOguMmb1JkKeR6xaifRf9Q.png)

The top-20 fastest-growing repositories of startups in Q2 2020.

Most of the successful open source startups typically end up with an HQ in San Francisco Bay Area but could be founded everywhere. Noteworthy, 80% of the fastest-growing companies from the list were founded outside the Bay Area. A breeding ground for open-source startups is Europe ‚Äî 12 out of 20 top startups were originated there, including 4 from Paris and 3 from Berlin.

Four repositories have an impressive combination of massive growth and numbers of stars ‚Äî 3 from France (**huggingface**, **genymobile**, **strapi**) and 1 from the eastern part of Canada (**corentinj**). Maybe the French language has a feature allowing to maintain high growth of OSS popularity at scale üòÇ

Finally, a methodological remark ‚Äî 5 organisations could gain momentum due to well-promoted funding announcements in Q2 (**prisma**, **streamlit**, **strapi**, **vector-im,** **rasahq**) and 2 organisations were intentionally excluded from the list because they are not ‚Äústartups‚Äù: [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) (non-commercial), [Aqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com/) (raised $100M+). Enjoy the list!

The benchmarks above could be used to detect outstanding open-source startups. Stars, forks and their growth rates are measurable, but indirect factors of a product‚Äôs adoption within the global developer community.

Also don‚Äôt mix correlation with causation ‚Äî lack of popularity at Github does not say about low quality and could be caused by various reasons. The best illustration is Runa‚Äôs ex-portfolio company Nginx (acquired for $670M) ‚Äî it [powers ~450M websites](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2020/06/25/june-2020-web-server-survey.html) in the world and has just 12.2K stars at Github.
