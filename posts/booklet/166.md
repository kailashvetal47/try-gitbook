#  CIFS speeds with FreeNAS on Proxmox? | ServeTheHome Forums
I'm building a new AIO and FreeNAS on Proxmox seemed pretty interesting. I started playing around with FreeNAS bare metal, and was getting over 100 MB/s speeds from a Win7 desktop to FreeNAS. I got FreeNAS working on Proxmox with passthrough on a LSI 9207, and now the same setup is only getting my 75-80 MB/s.

How much CIFS drop off can I expect, going from bare metal FreeNAS to FreeNAS on Proxmox? This seems like a config issue.

Hardware: 2 x E5-2670 64GB RAM Asrock Rack EP2C602-4LD16 LSI 9207-8i (pass through to FreeNAS) 10 x HGST Deskstar 7K4000 (raidz2)

Software: Proxmox 4.1 FreeNAS 9.3 (4 cores, 32GB RAM)
