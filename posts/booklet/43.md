**5 Things You Must Know If You Love An Empath**

Empaths are individuals born with an amazing talent – they can pick up on the energy of those around them.

Within seconds of meeting someone, they know exactly what the other person is feeling.

They have the power to connect with someone else in the most intimate of ways, and this manifests itself in the most loving and selfless of ways.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/young-woman-1149643_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/young-woman-1149643_1280.jpg)

However, there is a downside that comes with being an empath.

The ability to tap into everyone’s feelings can leave both uplift and drain them.

If you are in a relationship with an empath, you’ll have noticed that they have special needs when it comes to love and affection.

Here are five things to keep in mind:

# **1. They know exactly how you feel, and they always want to help you feel better:**

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/female-alcoholism-2847443_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/female-alcoholism-2847443_1280.jpg)

Your empath partner will pick up on your emotional state before you even have the chance to open your mouth. This can be quite unnerving at first but, for an empath, it feels natural.

Empaths feel their partners’ pain so keenly that they want to make it go away immediately, or at least talk about it.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/people-2603383_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/people-2603383_1280.jpg)

If you are the kind of person who prefers to sit on your feelings for a while before trying to resolve them, you will need to be upfront about your needs.

Otherwise, your partner will wonder why you are rejecting their help.

# **2. They are excellent at spotting liars:**

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/womens-2349048_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/womens-2349048_1280.jpg)

You cannot get away with deceiving an empath. They are quick to spot inconsistencies in body language, and their intuition soon kicks in when someone tries to mislead them.

What’s more, they find it hard to forgive anyone who tries to dupe them.

Although they are the most understanding and tolerant people on the planet, they place such a high value on truth that just one instance of deception can be enough for them to walk away from a relationship.

# **3. They may have been badly burned in the past:**

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/anxiety-1024x511.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/anxiety-1024x511.jpg)

Unfortunately, empaths are vulnerable to predators like narcissists, sociopaths, and [energy vampires](http://powerfulmind.co/energy-vampires-in-your-life/).

By the time they reach adulthood, they will probably have been burned by several people who have taken advantage of their good nature.

Empaths know on an intuitive level when someone is trying to hurt them, but they may stay in bad relationships because they desperately hope something will change.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/woman-3083390_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/woman-3083390_1280.jpg)

It might take a few toxic relationships before they learn to draw firm boundaries and move on from people who drain them.

Don’t be surprised if they are slow to trust you at first.

# **4. They probably worry that you won’t understand them:**

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/emoji-2428737_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/emoji-2428737_1280.jpg)

One of the most challenging aspects of being an empath is the ongoing feeling of being misunderstood.

Empaths usually grow up being told by their parents and teachers that they are “too sensitive” or that they “need to live in the real world.”

Some will have been bullied simply for being different.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/girl-2619288_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/girl-2619288_1280.jpg)

Show your partner that you are willing to learn more about the empath experience.

Ask them to recommend books and websites you can read.

Ask them to tell you what it was like to grow up with the ability to tune into other people’s emotions.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/flower-731300_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/flower-731300_1280.jpg)

They will appreciate sincere questions, and talking about their experiences will help you grow closer as a couple.

# **5. They like and need to spend time alone:**

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/girl-2606426_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/girl-2606426_1280.jpg)

We all feel overwhelmed at times, but empaths need much more personal space in which to wind down and regain their composure, particularly during times of stress.

Don’t worry if they tell you they need to be alone for a couple of days.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/purposes-1963850_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/purposes-1963850_1280.jpg)

It doesn’t mean they have fallen out of love with you; they simply need to regain their emotional stability.

As a non-empath, it may be hard for you to imagine experiencing such extreme emotions.

Sometimes, your partner might seem oversensitive.

For example, they may be moved to tears within seconds of seeing or hearing about a person or animal in pain.

## The best approach is to ask them how you can best support them.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/hipster-869222_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/hipster-869222_1280.jpg)

You might not be able to understand what it’s like to possess empathic traits, but you can show your love by offering comfort and support when the world overwhelms them.

When an empath gives you their heart, you’ll learn what true love really looks like.

![43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/people-2604837_1280.jpg](43%2004bf6e1245364d989ab0e464ddf47085/people-2604837_1280.jpg)

Your happiness is their own, and they will always put your needs first.

Although it might not be easy to understand your partner and your love might not last forever, the relationship will leave you a wiser and better person.
