Hearing about the [undisputed benefits of Unity3D’s Addressable Assets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iauWgEXjkEY) I knew I *[needed](https://media.giphy.com/media/tN1lvnT4M6nte/giphy.gif)* them in my projects. If you’ve tried learning this feature before and was met with only overwhelming frustration, you're not alone! Starting out I was quickly disheartened with the currently available tutorials and talks. Taking an exorbitant amount of time to wrap my head around these systems, I’m here to take the sting out of it for you! Bonus tutorials have been created on how to use Unity and Addressable assets with each of the most popular cloud services Aws bucket, Azure blob, and the Google Cloud.

# Awesome Advantages of Addressable Assets!

- Quicker load times for testing
- Increased build speed

On top of all this awesome, it’s built on the [Scriptable BuildPipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.scriptablebuildpipeline@1.5/manual/index.html) which comes with its own set of unique benefits!

One of my favorite perks is that the Unity3D [programmers](https://forum.unity.com/members/unity_bill.1349377/) had the forethought to make the code asynchronous. This gives us the ability to wait for the assets to complete instantiating before we attempt to use them. Simply, call for an asset to be created and wait until it is with little to no effort on our part! [（。＾▽＾）](https://media.giphy.com/media/TJ9MxwF3KibO3bfhxY/giphy.gif)
