Most of Germany's 16 states have roadmap plans for when their tourism infrastructure can reopen during the month of May. We look at where travellers can go, and under what conditions.

With [two national public holidays on the horizon in the coming weeks](https://www.thelocal.de/20200106/what-and-when-are-germanys-2020-public-holidays), many in Germany are wondering where they can travel within the country.

We break down every state's plans on tourism and travel accommodation, with the exception of Hamburg and Bremen, who have yet to announce them.

**Baden-Württemberg**

Those eager to set up a tent in the Black Forest will have the chance soon: According to [a step-by-step plan](https://www.baden-wuerttemberg.de/fileadmin/redaktion/dateien/PDF/Coronainfos/200507_Stufenfahrplan_BW_StM.pdf) from the state government, holiday apartments and camping sites can be rented out again starting on Monday May 18th. On May 29th, hotels, visitor centres and leisure parks will also be able to open their doors.

**Bavaria**

Starting on May 30th, hotels, holiday apartments and campsites in Bavaria will again be allowed to receive guests, the southern state [announced earlier this month](https://www.bayern.de/bericht-aus-der-kabinettssitzung-vom-5-mai-2020/). However, strict conditions will apply to the opening of hotels, meaning that there will be no "offers with common use, especially wellness".

Other tourist offerings, such as castles, will also open from the Whitsun weekend, but only under certain conditions and with limited admission.
