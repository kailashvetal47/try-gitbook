#  Accelerate Storage Spaces with SSDs in Windows 10 Storage Pool tiers
Windows Server O/S contains Storage Spaces support for Server Spaces tiered storage. You can front slower spinning disks with smaller faster SSDs. Windows 10 has a Storage Spaces GUI Control Panel that does not include the tiered storage GUI. This means Powershell must be used for all configuration.

[https://github.com/freemansoft/win10-storage-spaces](https://www.blogger.com/) contains scripts that create tiered storage pools that integrate SSDs as caching drives and HDDs as storage drives. They assume you have at least one SSD and one HDD.

- The scripts automatically find all raw drives and add them to the pool.
- Some HDDs have their types incorrectly identified. The script can coerce them to be MediaType:HDD
- The entire virtual drive is added to the system as a single large volume
- You need at least
    - 1 SSD and 1 HDD to run cached storage / Simple resiliency
    - 2 SSD and 2 HDD to run cached storage / Mirror resiliency /
    - 1 SSD and 2 HDD to run cached storage / Simple resiliency / striped storage (sum of HDD space)

## Simple vs Mirror

The "Mirror" resiliency level attempts to mirror both SSD and HDD tiers so you would need 4 drives run mirror, to mirror both tiers

## new-storage-space.ps1

Creates a tiered storage pool and allocates all the disk space to a single drive

- You can change the drive letter and label by editing the variables at the top.
- the script can auto size the drive and cache. That didn't work for me so the script supports manual sizing.

## remove-storage-space

- All drives are returned the *Primordial* pool

- Much of the script came from this great blog [by Nils Schimmelmann](https://nils.schimmelmann.us/post/153541254987/intel-smart-response-technology-vs-windows-10)
- This blot is copied from the [git hub repository README.md](https://github.com/freemansoft/win10-storage-spaces)
