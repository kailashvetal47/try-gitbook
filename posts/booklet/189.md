title: c# - Calling Functions on Unity-Application embedded in Winforms-Application - Stack Overflow

#  c# - Calling Functions on Unity-Application embedded in Winforms-Application - Stack Overflow
I am currently developing a simple prototype for an editor. The editor will use WinForms (or WPF, if possible) to provide the main user interface and will also embed a Unity 2017 standalone application to visualise data and provide additional control elements (e.g. zoom, rotate, scroll, ...).

Thanks to this nice post below, getting an embedded Unity application to work within a WinForms-application was shockingly easy.

[https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-3d-within-windows-application-enviroment.236213/](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-3d-within-windows-application-enviroment.236213/)

Also, there is a simple example application, which you may access here:

Unfortunately, neither the example, nor any posts I could find answered a very basic question: *how do you pass data (or call methods) from your WinForms-application in your embedded Unity-application (and vice versa)?*

Is it possible for your WinForms-application to simply call MonoBehaviour-scripts or static methods in your Unity-application? If so, how? If not, what would be a good workaround? And how could the Unity-to-WinForms communication work in return?

**Update:**

Used the duplicate-pages mentioned by Programmer ([link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43062782/send-message-from-one-program-to-another-in-unity)) to implement a solution, which uses named pipes for communication between the WinForms- and Unity-application.

Both applications use BackgroundWorkers, the WinForms-application acts as server (since it is started first and needs an active connection-listener, before the client is started), while the embedded Unity-application acts as client.

Unfortunately, the Unity-application throws a NotImplementedException, stating "ACL is not supported in Mono" when creating the NamedPipeClientStream (tested with Unity 2017.3 and Net 2.0 (not the Net 2.0 subset)). This exception has already been reported in some comments in [the post mentioned above](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43062782/send-message-from-one-program-to-another-in-unity), but its unclear, if it has been solved. The proposed solutions of "make sure, that the server is up and running before the client tries to connect" and "start it in admin mode" have been tried, but failed so far.

**Solution:**

After some more testing, it became clear, that the "ACL is not supported in Mono" exception was caused the TokenImpersonationLevel-parameter used when creating the NamedPipeClientStream-instance. Changing it to TokenImpersonationLevel.None solved the issue.

Here the code used by the WinForms-application, which acts as a named pipe server. Make sure, this script is executed, BEFORE the Unity-application client tries to connect! Also, make sure, that you have build and released the Unity-application before you start the server. Place the Unity executable of your Unity-application in the WinForms-applications folder and name it "Child.exe".

Attach this code to a GameObject within your Unity-application. Also make sure to reference a GameObject with a TextMeshProUGUI-component (TextMeshPro-Asset, you'll find it in your Asset Store) to the 'textObject'-member, so the application doesn't crash and you can see some debug information. Also (as stated above) make sure you build and release your Unity-application, name it "Child.exe" and put it in the same folder as your WinForms-application.
