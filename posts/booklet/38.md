#  Yes, I’ve Changed - I’ve Started Cutting People Off And Respecting Myself More
![respect-yourself-1.jpg](38%20757b58845e144a139acb46b90f7218cb/respect-yourself-1.jpg)

Having self-respect is the very first step on the journey of self-acceptance. It’s understanding our worth, acknowledging our values, our true nature and accepting ourselves just the way we are.

It all comes down to being the kind of person you truly wish to be without having a single care in the world what anybody says about it. It’s having the courage to stand up for yourself and speak up about things that bother you, or worse, harm you.

When you finally reach that stage, you become more aware of who you are, and so the process of transformation starts.

You realize that things were blurry for a long time, and you now know that it is finally the time to take matters into your hands!

Here are 20 things you’ve started doing because you have self-respect now:

**1. You’ve started placing yourself on the top of the priority list.** Not to sound selfish, but who else is going to take care of yourself if you won’t do it?

**2. You’ve stopped accepting apologies and meaningless words** that aren’t followed by real action. Words are shallow. Actions are what matter the most.

**3. You finally understand that you have no responsibility to take care of other people’s problems.** Their issues are theirs. Sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong might only backfire in a nasty way.

**4. No more idly nodding while people are draining your energy** complaining about their problems in life that somehow magically always remain the same. Because, unlike them, you’ve decided to make the change within yourself.

**5. Cutting all the toxic relationships that inflicted you pain for a long time.** Nothing good can come off giving second chances to people who only take advantage of you.

**6. No longer justifying your actions to others.** Only you get to decide what you’re going to do with your life. No more explaining why you date someone, why you’ve changed your job.

**7. Answering people’s texts when you feel like it.** It’s not rude, nor selfish. It’s called self-care. It’s natural to need space for yourself.

**8. Going home when you feel like it. Or not going out when you want to stay at home.** You’ve finally come to the conclusion that you shouldn’t live your life according to some ignorant, socially-accepted rules.
