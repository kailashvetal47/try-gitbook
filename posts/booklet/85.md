Hyper-casual games became an industry buzzword when developer Voodoo saw an exponential increase in downloads, making them [the third best performing](https://sensortower.com/blog/top-apps-games-publishers-2018) game developer worldwide in 2017 – only losing out to Google and Facebook. The message was clear: hyper-casual games are in-demand and can be extremely successful. Hyper-casual games have sustained this popularity ever since and now generate between [$2 billion and $2.5 billion in annual revenue](https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/24/the-truth-about-hypercasual-games/). This guide will explain everything you need to know about this type of mobile game, including how you can make them, how they can be monetized, and what tools you need to get started.

## What are hyper-casual games?

Hyper-casual games are mobile games that offer instant gameplay and have simple mechanics such as stacking, turning, and falling. This type of mobile game is designed to be lightweight with minimal onboarding so that users can instantly tap to play. When done right, the simplicity of a hyper-casual game makes it extremely engaging and addictive.

Hyper-casual games are also defined by their target audience. While hardcore games will target loyal gamers who will spend large sums on a single game, hyper-casual games appeal to the mass market. Their accessibility and ease of understanding the mechanics mean that they can attract a large audience and generate revenue with a freemium monetization model.

Hyper-casual games usually have a single mechanic and a minimalistic interface. When a gamer opens a hyper-casual gaming app, it’s important for them to be able to access the game within seconds. Because the game itself is simple, it’s important for hyper-casual games to be aesthetically pleasing and have a satisfying progression model. These games are designed to be played over several short sessions. Another benefit to this type of gaming app is that it will take up less space on a user’s device than other types of games, making them more convenient for the user and less likely to be uninstalled.
