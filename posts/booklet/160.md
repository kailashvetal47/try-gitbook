#  Graphics Card Comparison Chart
Ranking Graphics Cards from Most Powerful to Least

Finding the best graphics card for your money involves serious research. This page ranks graphics cards from best to worst.

This list consists of graphics cards released in roughly the last five years. To see even older cards or any graphics card you don't see here, please consult the [Tom's Hardware GPU Hierarchy Table](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html).

The list starts with the **best, most powerful** graphics cards **first**, from both NVIDIA and AMD. Wherever the two brands are essentially equivalent in power, they appear on the same row. The **numbers** above the cards compare their performance to the [GTX 1080 Ti](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XH2P8DD/?tag=li-org-guide-gpucomparison-us-20).

Please note: These graphics card rankings are **approximate**. Performance will vary from game to game. When possible, we suggest doing your own performance research on the games you want to play. In some games, some graphics cards will perform slightly better than cards above them, or slightly worse than cards below.

The **Resolution and FPS bars** give a **rough idea** of how well each graphics card performs with **mainstream, demanding games** at the given specification.
