#  FreeNAS performance to Proxmox ZFS | ServeTheHome Forums
I'm looking at 11.2-stable. I love the new UI but it's feeling really tired.

I'm considering installing Proxmox and using it as a ZFS file server. I've got a Xeon D-1541 and this is an 8x 3.5 8TB server. CPU and memory I've got lots of. My other nodes are Proxmox so I'm looking at FreeNAS and I'm like why not just make it a bigger Proxmox cluster with a ZFS node?

I keep some files in private network shares only accessible via a VLAN to Windows. I'm stuck with 1G between the NAS and Windows.

I've heard horror stories on ZFS performance. Can ZFS Proxmox fill 1G Network on sequential writes without a ZIL? FreeNAS can.
