Cloudron has a built-in firewall and all events can be audited. Apps are run isolated from one another using Docker containers.

# Organizations using Cloudron

Running critical infrastructure and depending on the availability of volunteers when it comes to critical updates - not a brilliant idea. We are glad that we can now focus our energy on our members and main objectives instead of keeping an eye on the tools, thanks to Cloudron's built-in administrator.
