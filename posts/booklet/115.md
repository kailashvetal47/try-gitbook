## About the book

This book dives deeply into JavaScript:

- It teaches practical techniques for using the language better.
- It teaches how the language works and why. What it teaches is firmly grounded in the ECMAScript specification (which the book explains and refers to).
- It covers only the language (ignoring platform-specific features such as browser APIs) but not exhaustively. Instead, it focuses on a selection of important topics.
