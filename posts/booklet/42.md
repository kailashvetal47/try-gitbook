> Read this article if you want to demystify Functional Programming and understand why and how to start using FP paradigms in C#.

In the title I have written FP and C# but the question you probably wonder is :

Here are some arguments to answer this question (from my POV) :

- Write less code and more meaningful one : improved code clarity
- Avoid side effects by using immutability and pure functions : Easier concurrent programming
- Easier testing : it’s really easy to test functions
- Easier debugging
- Funnier to write

## OK but why don’t we use a FP language instead of C# ?

In companies it’s really hard to change the habits. We don’t all work in the Sillicon Valley and in my reality the latest versions in the production environments are : Java 8, .NET Framework 4, NodeWhat ?, …

In my world organizations are not yet ready to invest in pure FP languages like F#, Kotlin, Clojure or whatever. They are stuck in legacy code…

To go further on this topic I invite you to watch this video on ***Functional Core, Imperative Shell*** : [https://discventionstech.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/functional-core-and-imperative-shell/](https://discventionstech.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/functional-core-and-imperative-shell/)

It’s a pattern that could be really useful to every developers on earth I think.

**Functional core (declarative)** composed of pure functions (in / out) and easy to test without any mocks.

**Imperative shell or reactive** container the service logic that you can test with integration tests

Now I have proved the interest of FP in OO language let’s go for a quick lesson.
