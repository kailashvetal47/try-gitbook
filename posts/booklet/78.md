How long you stay in a rented place with access to limited facilities? Is your data secure at your service providers server? Do you think your data has been shared to any third-party services? Forgot to renew the monthly subscription of your SaaS application?

Now put a halt to all those questions running in your mind, and let’s evolve with the solution of Self-hosting. It allows a private and secure communication and collaboration across your on-premise servers. The name itself hints us its meaning. So we’ll see what it exactly does?

## *What is self-hosting?*

Buy an application right upfront and host it on your [servers](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/server), instead of accessing it from the [public cloud servers](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/public-cloud). Self-hosting is the process of downloading, installing and accessing some software or application with your domain name from the servers that you own. It extends end-to-end application management with full-scale data privacy and security at your controlled infrastructure and environment.
