This year, TechGig is celebrating the #NationalTechnologyDay2020 for the whole week, by sharing anecdotes on technologies and technologists that make India proud. In this series, we have already talked about [India's wonderful young innovators](https://content.techgig.com/NationalTechnologyDay2020-Meet-Indias-wonderful-young-innovators/articleshow/75710245.cms) and the [groundbreaking tech inventions made by Indian technocrats](https://content.techgig.com/4-Groundbreaking-IT-inventions-by-Indians-that-shaped-the-modern-world/articleshow/75740021.cms).

Today, in this write-up, we are talking about three programming languages that were invented by Indian computer scientists. Without any further ado, letâ€™s start.

**1. Julia** co-created by  **Viral B Shah** 
Julia programming language is quite popular nowadays among data science professionals. But, a very few people know that it was co-created by an Indian computer scientist Viral B Shah. Julia is an open-source, high-level and dynamic programming language that is best suited for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science. First launched in 2012, the language is gradually becoming a popular alternative to more established languages such as MATLAB and Python.

**2. Kojo** developed by  **Lalit Pant**

First appeared in 2010, Kojo is an open-source programming language and an integrated development environment (IDE) that is created and developed by Lalit Pant, a Dehradun, India based computer programmer and teacher. The language offers several features that enable computer-based learning through playing, exploring, developing the cognitive abilities like mental skills, (interactive) math, graphics, art, music, science, animation, games, and electronics.

It is primarily based on Scala programming where users begin with a simple subset of the language and progress in steps. Lalit says that he chose Scala for Kojo because of its low barrier to entry and potential power. Today, Kojo is used by several schools and classes around the world for the computer-based skill development of early-age learners.

**3. Visual J#** developed at  **Microsoft India Development Center in Hyderabad** 
However, now discontinued, the J# programming language was developed at the Hyderabad-based Microsoft India Development Center in India. J# and its implementation as Visual J# was a transitional language for programmers of Java and Visual J++ languages, so they could use their existing knowledge and applications on .NET Framework. It was introduced in 2002 and discontinued in 2007, with support for the final release of the product continuing until October 2017.
