Architector is a cloud-based or server-based tool to manage everything to do with the complex area of data lineage. Data lineage can be defined as the journey data takes from where it is created through to where it is used in reports, models, decisions, etc. It is vital for organisations to understand the lineage of data, otherwise they cannot properly understand the data they use, and therefore cannot really rely on results based on data. Data lineage contributes to the definition and understanding of data quality, data ownership and governance, and to the operational questions of deciding what data to use in what circumstances.

Here follows a snip of Architector's Concept Model tool:

The Core of FactGem's offering is the DATA FABRIC:

The FactGem Data Fabric connects data from platforms and applications, separated by purpose, geography, or organization, into a unified, service-enabled, graph endpoint.
Stored as a cohesive and visual model, data can be expressed as the entities, relationships, transactions, and events that tie them together, providing for easy reporting and querying across the enterprise.

Factil Information Modeling Platform

We help businesses to take a model-driven approach to tackle the complexity of information modeling and data integration in relational, data warehouse and NoSQL data environments.

With our platform, the enterprise business information model is defined in an easily understood, controlled natural language. From the business information model, the platform can generate well-structured data schemas in a number of forms, transformation code between these forms, and associated artefacts such as business glossaries and data dictionaries.

The platform provides:

Web-based Business Information Model editor
Automated model inference from from source metadata
Automated schema generation to relational, staging and data vault forms
Automated transformation code generation from application to staging, staging to raw data vault and raw data vault to business data vault schemas
Automated documentation generation including Business Glossary, Logical Data Model and export to ER modeling tools

![80%204e048ed7eec4471f9bd6429a9899ed6e/factil-fact-model-graph.png](80%204e048ed7eec4471f9bd6429a9899ed6e/factil-fact-model-graph.png)

Factil comes out of the strong, Australian, fact based modeling community. The Factil platform contains different kinds of representations, also including data vault capabilities. What is shown here is the business level ORM (Object Role Model) diagram style, which has been around for quite some years, and which I admit do have some strong points. My primary disagreement lies in the area of simplicity and intuitiveness (which is hindered by the visual syntax elements). I do recommend approaches like this very complex tasks like for example complex public service systems or systems designed to take equipment to Mars (or other places where failure is not an option).

Grafo lets you design knowledge graphs the same way you present them: visually.

Grakn is the knowledge graph engine to organise complex networks of data and making it queryable, by performing knowledge engineering.

Rooted in Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning, Grakn provides the knowledge foundation for cognitive and intelligent (e.g. AI) systems, by providing an intelligent language for modelling, transactions and analytics. Being a distributed database, Grakn is designed to scale over a network of computers through partitioning and replication.

Grakn allows you to model your domain using the well-known Entity-Relationship model at its full expressivity. It is composed of entity types, relationship types, and attribute types.

Unlike other modelling languages, Grakn allows you to define type hierarchies, hyper-entities, hyper-relations, and rules to build rich knowledge models.

The schema is defined by way of a visual knowledge schema editor:

![80%204e048ed7eec4471f9bd6429a9899ed6e/stacks-image-9655b72.png](80%204e048ed7eec4471f9bd6429a9899ed6e/stacks-image-9655b72.png)

Grakn is based on an underlying hypergraph DBMS and it supports (among other things) the Apache Tinkerpop property graph interface.

Graphileon helps business consultants and information analysts to rapidly design and deploy graph-based applications by exploiting the agility of graphs.

**Graphileon use cases:** Graphs are on the rise. Graphileon offers the tools to easily use them in a wide range of situations. Consultants use Graphileon to model data and to create (prototype) applications and developers do their magic using the integrated javascript libraries. In addition, Graphileon empowers others to offer solutions to extremely graphy problems.

**One of the use cases is user-friendly and controlled data-management!**

Using a **Schemabuilder** and a Databuilder to control the categories of users that are allowed to add new attributes to nodes and relationships, while providing other users with access to forms to enter data.

One of the advantages of property graphs like Neo4j, in which both nodes and relationships can have properties, is their versatility and freedom with regard to create and update models. However, this freedom comes with responsibility. Sometimes you may want to control the categories of users that are allowed to add new attributes to nodes and relationships, while you want to provide other users access to forms to enter data.

In the Schemabuilder (above), nodetypes and relationtypes are created, then linked to attributes with different datatypes (string, integer etc). Graphileon takes care of storing the schema, if needed in a separate graph store. Both nodetypes and relationtypes can inherit attributes.

Hackolade offers agile visual data modeling for JSON, NoSQL, and multimodel databases , and it now supports Neo4j graph data models as well.
It was specifically built to support the data modeling of Neo4j node labels and relationship types. The application closely follows the terminology of the database. To be clear, Hackolade is not a graph visualization tool, but a tool for data modeling of Neo4j graph databases - and many other databases, most lately ArangoDB.

Maana's vision is to encode the world’s industrial expertise and data into new digital knowledge for millions of experts to make better and faster decisions.

With that vision Maana has pioneered the Maana Knowledge Platform™, a knowledge-centric technology that has been developed over the past 4 years, while solving the most complex operational challenges of Global Fortune 500 industrial companies. The Maana Knowledge Platform turns human expertise and data into digital knowledge for employees to make better and faster decisions.

The "secret sauce" is the patented Knowledge Graph™ — the invention at the core of the platform that combined with Maana’s algorithms, expedite extracting knowledge from data silos and information sources, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing assets and processes.

JoinAssist guides users in finding non-obvious relations, even when the user does not fully understand their data relationships. Often, users have a good understanding of the available data, but the effort to manually connect it all to create large data models is difficult and time consuming. Maana’s user-guided, machine-assisted mechanism provides a visual interface to automatically build the relevant joins – and with little manual intervention.

KnowledgeModelAssist: Visually build knowledge models – the fundamental building blocks for Knowledge Applications – from pertinent “problem” questions such as, “Given a vessel, omitted port, and date, what are the set of alternative port options ranked by score?” With KnowledgeModelAssist, you can search concepts, bring them into the workspace, define relationships between them and apply appropriate functions in order to digitize your subject-matter expertise.

Neo4j is the leading graph data platform.

Although it does not require a schema or a declared data model, it does have a function called "db.schema()". It will analyze the data and infer the schema from the data.

Neo4j (and other graph databases) are actually great for building metadata repositories.

To the right you see the inferred schema of the IMDB movie database. It is displayed in the standard, built-in graph data browser, which is part of the platform.

John Singer, Founder and CEO says this about NodeEra:
After 35 years of working with relational databases, I discovered Neo4j and the property graph data model. Like you, I could see the advantages of this new approach to representing information in a database.

While the property graph won’t be replacing all relational databases (yet), it is particularly well suited for what I was working on.

As a relational data modeler, data analyst, DBA, I soon discovered that Neo4j lacked the types of tools I was used to working with – data modeling and query management – so I set out to build the tools I wish I had and NodeEra was born!

One of the exciting aspects of Neo4j’s property graph model is it’s “schema-on-demand” design. NodeEra implements this dynamic, iterative approach to property graph design that I believe you will find useful, more productive, and best of all – fun!

RuleArts was conceived in November 2004 out of a strong belief that technology-independent business rules should be owned by the business. The business should be supported by tools that allow them to verify and validate the rules on completeness and consistency. The development of RuleXpress to fulfill these needs began shortly thereafter. It became the first true Business Rule Management tool for Business People.

FactXpress is a business-focused tool designed to easily create consistent graphical fact models (business models). It is integrated in RuleXpress but can also be used as a standalone product.
