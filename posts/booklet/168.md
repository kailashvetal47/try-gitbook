Did you make any progress with this error?

I also have a Gigabyte AM2+ board on which I am attempting to run Proxmox installer 6.2.

and am seeing a similar issue:

"hdaudio hdaudioc0d0: Unable to bind to the codec"

And yes, I know that I can install Debian then upgrade it, but I didn't want to do that this time because I particularly dug out this old computer so that I could use it to experience the full installer experience (and thus wipe the ssd) to see how in particular it handles zfs.

And yes, I did try disabling the chipset advanced audio codec feature in BIOS, no change.

Perhaps the audio codec is for the Radeon R5 230 card ?

Any help or suggestions at all welcome!

Can anyone point me towards instructions howto edit the linux kernel command line (for the installer, obvs.) so that I might try forcing driver changes?

Thanks!

p.s.

A Forum search did not find me any other candidate answers, although a G**gle search did find some similarity:

["**hdaudio hdaudioC0D2: Unable to bind the codec"**](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2437409)

['**HELP, “hdaudioC0D3: unable to bind codec” cant boot up'**](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1160174/help-hdaudioc0d3-unable-to-bind-codec-cant-boot-up)

I'm still not really sure if this is the real error or just some unrelated message. Trying out setting "nomodeset" as a test seems like a good idea.

Hit the "e" key when the "Install Proxmox VE" options is highlighted. Then navigate to the line starting with "linux" go to the end add options and hit "CTRL+x" once ready to continue boot.

Thankyou. Doing exactly as you suggested has allowed me to progress into bootup of the installer.

Removing 'silent' and 'splashscreen' has enabled me to watch the boot proceeding, before arriving at "switching to radeondrmfb from VESA VGA".

No need for nomodeset.

I think your suspicion about that audio warning NOT being important may be correct, as I thought that I saw that audio error scroll past as part of the (verbose) bootup.

Thankyou for your help.
