Im running Promox VE from an Lenovo Thinkpad T420s. I know it isnt optimal, but i do it for testing purposes, trying to better get to know Promox VE.

My issue is being able to close the lid on the laptop.  I have edited the /etc/systemd/logind.conf-file, and set the following configurations.:

[Login] #NAutoVTs=6 #ReserveVT=6 #KillUserProcesses=no #KillOnlyUsers= #KillExcludeUsers=root #InhibitDelayMaxSec=5 #HandlePowerKey=poweroff #HandleSuspendKey=ignore #HandleHibernateKey=ignore #HandleLidSwitch=ignore #HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore #PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=no #SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=no #HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=no #LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=yes #HoldoffTimeoutSec=30s #IdleAction=ignore #IdleActionSec=30min #RuntimeDirectorySize=10% #RemoveIPC=yes #InhibitorsMax=8192 #SessionsMax=8192 #UserTasksMax=33%

Then i made a systemctl restart systemd-logind, and rebooted the system.

But when i try closing the lid, it turns off the light from the screen, when the lid is closed nearly to 1/3 of an inch. So it doesnt even close totally to where the lid contacts the rest of the laptop, before it makes an error.  When i open up the screen again it says  [85.190403] ACPI: \_SB_.PCIO.LPC.EC__.BAT1: Unable to dock!

When the screen is turned off, i cant connect to the webinterface or ssh to it. It seems to turn of the system.

What is to try next? I've offcause tried searching for this error but with no succes..
