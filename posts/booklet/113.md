Xiaomi Mijia Mi Sphere and Madv Madventure 360 Bluetooth remote

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/madv-10.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/madv-10.jpg)

Madventure 360

Yes. The Mi Sphere now has 360 metadata for photos, GPS tagging option, and has an intervalometer. These features make it suited for mapping.**How good is the stabilization?** The Xiaomi’s stabilization is excellent. [See this stabilization comparison](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/garmin-virb-360-vs-xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-stabilization-test-360-video.html) versus a $799 Garmin Virb 360. Note: the drifting has now been fixed as of version 1.8.3 of the app.

**Where do I download the app / software?** – Please download the [Windows app here](http://www.madv360.com/en/appstore/pc) – Mac app: not yet available as of 11/27/17 – [iOS app here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1125886893) – Android app source 1: [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madv360.madv.sig&hl=en) – Android app source 2: [Direct from Xiaomi](http://app.xiaomi.com/details?id=com.madv360.madv&from=singlemessage): you can choose to download from Xiaomi instead of the Google Play store. Sometimes the app from Xiaomi direct download is newer. – If you want an older or newer unofficial version of the Android app, [see Michel Mendes’ archive here](http://ez-team.com/xiaomi.html).

**How do I upgrade firmware? Where is the latest firmware? Do I have the latest firmware?** [Latest firmware download page](http://www.madv360.com/firmware.html)**.**  Installation guide: [See this tutorial here](https://360rumors.com/2017/08/xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-update-adds-intervalometer-features-heres-update-app-firmware.html). If you want to upgrade the firmware via Micro SD card, [pls. see here](https://360rumors.com/ultimate-xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-360-camera-faq-wiki-and-resource-page/).

**How do I upgrade the app? How do I download the latest app?** [See this tutorial here.](https://360rumors.com/2017/08/xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-update-adds-intervalometer-features-heres-update-app-firmware.html)

**What kind of Micro SD card should I get? I keep getting a warning that I need to use a recommended SD card.** Due to the Mi Sphere’s high video resolution, you need to use a Micro SD card with a U3 speed rating. The faster the Micro SD speed, the longer you can record without the camera overheating. If the card is very slow, you may get dropped frames. The best Micro SD card right now is the **Sandisk Extreme Pro** ([32GB](http://amzn.to/2vfdsnm) or [64GB](http://amzn.to/2weOd92) or [128GB](http://amzn.to/2vPKQV3)), which I sometimes use but it costs more. I use the **[Samsung EVO Select** Micro SD (64GB](http://amzn.to/2fwbnB3) or [128GB](http://amzn.to/2vndKvv)) with no issues. Even if you get an Sandisk Extreme Pro, you’ll still get a warning that you need to use a recommended SD card.

**How much capacity do I need for the Micro SD card?** A one-minute video will take up approximately 300 MB (this will include the main video file and the small preview file).

**Can the camera be connected to a USB power source while recording?** Yes.

**How long can the camera record? How long can it record before overheating?** The amount of time before overheating depends on the ambient temperature, air circulation, and the speed of your memory card. In a small room with no fan and closed doors and windows (i.e., no ventilation and no air circulation), with a temperature of around 72 Fahrenheit, and using a [Samsung EVO Select micro SD card (64GB)](http://amzn.to/2vPxhFa), I was able to record 1 hour 35 minutes before the camera shutdown from overheating. Under the same conditions but plugged into a USB outlet, I recorded for 1 hour 45 minutes. It is possible to record for longer duration under better conditions.

**How do I turn on the image stabilization?** Tip 1: Turn on the camera, wait for the video LED light to turn on, then wait 5 secs for the gyro to warm up. Make sure the camera starts in vertical position, then you can begin recording.

Tip 2: Before you start recording, the camera must be upright. Then you can start recording. After you start recording, it can be any position. If you start recording while the camera is not upright, e.g. horizontal, then its starting position will become what is considered “vertical” in the video. So if it’s horizontal, it will remain horizontal.

**What are the disadvantages of stabilization?** 1. After a few minutes, the video will start to drift. [Here is how to fix the drift](https://youtu.be/rgZTEAi5d6w?t=3m15s). UPDATE: the drift has been fixed as of version 1.8.3 of the app. 2. There is a waviness in the video, like a heat wave effect. It is most noticeable in static scenes. UPDATE: this issue has been fixed as well.

**How do I turn off stabilization?**Method 1: If stitching on the Xiaomi smartphone app, load the video in the gallery, then tap on the three dots on the lower right corner, then toggle the gyro correction off before exporting. Method 2: If stitching on the Xiaomi desktop app, toggle the gyro correction off before exporting**Does the Xiaomi Mijia Mi Sphere have live streaming?** No (as of August 2017). There are rumors that it will be added.

**Is the Xiaomi Mijia Mi Sphere waterproof?**[It is water resistant, but it is not waterproof](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/can-xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-swim-waterproofing-test-life-360.html). If you want to use it underwater, please use [this waterproof case](https://goo.gl/Usxw6w).

## HOW TO STITCH RAW and GET OPTICAL FLOW STITCHING WITH THE XIAOMI MIJIA MI SPHERE

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv.jpg)

Mi Sphere Converter

Yoichi Hirota, developer of Theta Converter, has created an app for optical flow stitching of the Mi Sphere photos, called Mi Sphere Converter. It can also be used for stitching RAW photos. It has smoother stitching than the Mi Sphere app, and is useful for **stitching raw files shot on version 1.8.4 of the app** and above (the raw DNG files must be converted to JPG before processing with Mi Sphere Converter). Here is a link to [actual 360 samples](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Mijia360cam/permalink/470112976717160/). The samples show smoother stitching for subjects at the stitch line even near the camera. It also has more even blending of color.

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv-2.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv-2.jpg)

Mi Sphere stitching can be seamless with MiSphere Converter

The alpha version of the app is [available here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hirota41.mijiaconverter&hl=en) (it will work only until December 31). The [final version of the app is available here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hirota41.misphereconverter&hl=en).

In order to use MiSphere Converter, you need to calibrate the lens. Every camera has a unique calibration. Here is a [great tutorial by Janis Bertrands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Mijia360cam/permalink/471884616539996/) that shows the how and why of lens calibration, and how to use MiSphere Converter. Eddie Pearce has also created a [video tutorial for the lens calibration](https://www.facebook.com/100007676296094/videos/1933881436877714/) for Misphere Converter.

**How do you download the unstitched photos from the Mi Sphere for stitching on MiSphere Converter?**

There are several ways to do it. One way is to use the Micro SD card and a Micro SD card reader. A second way is to use an OTG cable. A third way is to do it wirelessly by connecting to your Mi Sphere and then using your browser to navigate to http://192.168.42.1:50422/ [Check out this tutorial by Pepe Vazquez (360 Tips & Tricks)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUNb6Fw5wgk).

1. Connect to the MiSphere via wifi. The default password is 12345678. Do not launch the Mi Sphere app.

2. Open the browser (e.g. Safari or Chrome) and in the address bar, enter 192.168.42.1:50422 (bookmark this for future reference). This will show the directory of the Mi Sphere’s Micro SD card.

3. Go to the folder you want to download photos from (it’s arranged by date) and tap to select a photo.

4. When the photo is loaded, tap on it (on iPhone, tap and hold the photo for 3 seconds — do not use Force Touch). A popup will ask if you want to save the image. Save it. The photo is now in your gallery (for iPhone, it will be under All Photos).

5. Repeat for all the photos.

MiSphere Converter is only for photos. For videos, you can use Mistika VR ([available here](https://www.sgo.es/vr-plans?affiliates=1ff1de774005f8da13f42943881c655f)) for optical flow stitching. Below is an easy tutorial for Mistika. Although I used Garmin Virb for the tutorial, the same steps apply when using Mistika with Xiaomi Mi Sphere (yes there is a Mistika preset for Mi Sphere).

## **MADVENTURE 360**

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/madv-17.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/madv-17.jpg)

Madventure 360 camera

The [Madventure 360](https://360rumors.com/2017/10/madventure-360-features-specifications-new-version-xiaomi-mi-sphere.html) is a rebranded version of the Xiaomi, repackaged for Western markets. In addition to its distinctive orange color, the Madventure comes with the dedicated selfie stick, a GoPro-style adapter plus the usual accessories for the Mi Sphere. The Madventure hardware is exactly identical to that of the Xiaomi Mi Sphere. In terms of software features, as of March 2018, they are identical, although in the future, it is possible that MADV may add new features that might not be included in the Mi Sphere app.

## **List of new features as of January 2018**

In January 2018, Xiaomi app version 1.8.8 was released, which incorporates several features (some of these features were already released in version 1.8 and subsequent versions). 1. 4K resolution. Users can now select a resolution of 3840 x 1920. However, please note that the increased resolution is interpolated therefore there is no increase in actual detail. However, if you are editing the Mi Sphere footage with other 4K camera videos, it is easier not to have to resize the Mi Sphere. 2. Bullet time effect. In the video resolution, you can select a resolution of 2048 x 512 @ 120fps which allows you to shoot a hemispherical video at 120 fps. You ca use this video mode while spinning the Xiaomi around on a selfie stick to create a bullet time effect. 3. Improved exposure controls. The main window now includes exposure controls for ISO, shutter speed, and exposure compensation. You can also control white balance. This means you can make these adjustments without going through the menus. 4. Raw DNG photo mode. Xiaomi can take photos in DNG format. The double circular fisheye file would have to be stitched using software such as the MiSphere Converter. 5. In-camera photo stitching. There is an option for in-camera stitching for photos. The stitching will be template based (and therefore will not be as smooth as with in-app stitching), but this could be a time saver for people who need to take many 360 photos. 6. Bracketing. In the main window, while in photo mode, there is an option for bracketing, which can take 3 photos up to +/- 3EV. 7. Save to SD card. In the sign in screen of the app, when you click on “More Help,” there is a new option to save files to SD card (if your phone has a Micro SD card slot). 8. Battery meter. On the main screen, there is now a visual indicator for battery life. 9. Other improvements (from version 1.8) – Intervalometer: among other things, this should enable you to take photos with a drone without using a remote control. – Slow motion video mode – GPS tagging for photos and videos – You can now use the volume buttons on your phone as the shutter – EXIF data added to photos – Screen recording feature (overcapture effect). When viewing videos, there is an option called “Record” which lets you record the screen while playing back the video in either tiny planet view or spherical view. The result is a static 16:9 video that you can save as a separate file. – Sharing to Weibo and VeeR.

2. [Selfie stick tripod](https://goo.gl/1qPJuR). Benro MK10 is invisible to the Xiaomi IF you remove the ballhead. [See here for more info](https://360rumors.com/2017/01/review-benro-mk-10-is-my-new-favorite.html).

3. [Here is a cheap selfie stick](https://360rumors.com/2017/06/effortless-invisibility-cheap-selfie-stick-also-invisible-360-cameras.html) that is also invisible to the Xiaomi. Available from [Gearbest](https://www.gearbest.com/photography-accessories/pp_140023.html?lkid=10383763) or [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2sPgaQX). 4. [This is the best “Lens cap” for the Xiaomi](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/heres-best-lens-cap-360-camera.html). [See why](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/heres-best-lens-cap-360-camera.html). This pouch protects from dust and scratches, and can be used for cleaning. But it does not protect from drops. You still need to use a camera case. 5. [Silicone cover and lens cap for the Xiaomi](http://amzn.to/2wVBS9r). This is a soft silicone rubber cover for the Xiaomi, and includes a silicone rubber lens cap as well. Note: I don’t know if it will have any effect on overheating but I use a similar lens cap for my Gear 360. 6. [Camera case (rapid use)](https://goo.gl/b9CsHw) – [See this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toJUvppvsW4&index=5&list=PLtGqGHDrZeFi5qPAnO0MGYJTqRxP1NXNh). This camera case is useful both as a lens cap and as a camera case. I use it with the Agent 8 microfiber pouch above.

7. [Camera case (crushproof)](https://goo.gl/1P2Jaz) – [See this demo video](https://360rumors.com/2017/06/perfect-camera-case-garmin-virb-360.html). The video shows a Virb 360 but it also fits the Xiaomi. 8. [Camera case (waterproof)](https://goo.gl/Usxw6w) – [See this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVE2Ip6dCHs&index=8&list=PLtGqGHDrZeFi5qPAnO0MGYJTqRxP1NXNh). 9. Faster way to transfer videos: use a Micro SD card reader. Using the Wi-Fi is slow and the camera heats up.

10. **NEW**! Dedicated Bluetooth Remote

Madv is releasing a dedicated Bluetooth remote accessory for the Mi Sphere (also works with [Madventure](https://360rumors.com/2017/12/madventure-360-features-specifications-new-version-xiaomi-mi-sphere.html)). It will be available on Amazon in April 2018, although price hasn’t been announced as of Feb. 8, 2018. Here is a video tutorial and demo:

How to pair the remote: 1. Turn on your camera. Wait for it to finish the startup. 2. Turn on the remote by pressing the shutter or power button. The remote will be in pairing mode. 3. Double-click the camera’s Wi-Fi button. You will hear a double beep. The camera and remote will pair with each other in a few seconds. 4. If the remote timed out it will say “Any key pairing”, just press any button to enter pairing mode again. And double click the Wi-Fi again.

Controls: 1. Power button (on the side) to switch between photo or video mode. 2. Shutter button to start/stop video or take a photo. 3. Hold down the settings button to bring up the settings menu. In the settings menu, press the power button to move between the options, shutter button to select the option. 4. If the camera goes to sleep from inactivity, you can remotely wake it up by pressing any button on the remote. 5. Hold down the remote’s power button to turn off both the camera and the remote.

The maximum range is 30 meters (without obstructions). Besides being a faster way to connect remotely to your camera, the remote accessory may save battery for your camera (and definitely your phone!). I will conduct further tests.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### 1. “Black Hole” or “Dracula” issue: With some Android phones

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/xiaomi-black-hole-issue.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/xiaomi-black-hole-issue.jpg)

Xiaomi Mi Sphere half black screen (black hole issue) problem and solution

In some Android phones, the preview does not show one of the lenses, resulting in a “black hole.” To fix it, upgrade the app to 1.2.1.17554 or above and toggle the option for rendering issue auto fix. When you take a photo or video, you’ll have 8 possible patches, and the app will cycle through them one by one to see which one works for your specific phone. If a patch doesn’t work, select “Try the next one.” When you find a patch that works for your phone, tap on the button “normal,” and the patch will be applied going forward. [More information about the black hole issue here](https://www.facebook.com/notes/xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-and-madv360-madventure-360-camera-users-and-fans/hot-fix-version-of-misphrercameramadventure360-android-for-blackhole-issue/514817948913329/).

### **2. HOW TO FIX BUZZING XIAOMI MIJIA MI SPHERE; How to update the firmware**

Some users have reported that their cameras are producing a clicking or buzzing noise that is most noticeable when in a quiet room. According to Madv engineers, this is a bug. The solution is to upgrade the firmware to 1.3.103.106.5.16574 or later. Check if your app makes that firmware available ([here’s how](https://360rumors.com/2017/08/xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-update-adds-intervalometer-features-heres-update-app-firmware.html)). If the firmware is not available via the app, you’ll have to update the firmware manually by downloading it to a Micro SD card. The firmware is [available here](http://ez-team.com/xiaomi.html).

Here’s how to upgrade the firmware via Micro SD: 1. Make sure your camera has a full charge. 2. After downloading the firmware in .zip format, rename the .zip firmware file to “MadvSysFW.zip” If files extensions are hidden in your computer, just name it “MadvSysFW”. The filename is very important. If it is not called MadvSysFW.zip, your camera could be bricked. 3. In your Micro SD card, find a directory called “update” (if there isn’t one, create that directory). Delete all the files in that directory. 4. Copy the “MadvSysFW.zip” file to the update directory on the Micro SD card. 5. Turn off the camera and insert the Micro SD card to the camera. 6. While the camera is off, hold down the Wi-Fi button and press the power button (use a short press for the power button). 7. when the Photo and Video LED lights are flashing, you can release the Wi-Fi button. The flashing lights mean that the firmware is updating. 8. When the firmware update is complete, there will be a chime and the camera will shut off. 9. Turn the camera on. It will restart one more time. Congratulations!

**3. I got my Xiaomi but it can’t take a photo or video. The LED only flashes red and blue when I take a photo or video. What should I do?**

This means your SD card needs to be formatted. To be safe, format it with the Xiaomi Mi Sphere app. In the camera mode, go to settings on the upper right corner. In the settings page, near the bottom you will see a format function.

**4. The firmware update failed. My camera has been bricked. What do I do? How do I do a factory reset?**

There are 2 steps for a factory reset: 1. Remove the Micro SD card, backup the files, format the card and reinsert it in the camera. 2. While the camera is off, press the Wi-Fi button (the middle button), then hold the power button until the two LED lights on the front of the camera start flashing.

Madventure 360

Yes. The Mi Sphere now has 360 metadata for photos, GPS tagging option, and has an intervalometer. These features make it suited for mapping.**How good is the stabilization?** The Xiaomi’s stabilization is excellent. [See this stabilization comparison](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/garmin-virb-360-vs-xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-stabilization-test-360-video.html) versus a $799 Garmin Virb 360. Note: the drifting has now been fixed as of version 1.8.3 of the app.

**Where do I download the app / software?** – Please download the [Windows app here](http://www.madv360.com/en/appstore/pc) – Mac app: not yet available as of 11/27/17 – [iOS app here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1125886893) – Android app source 1: [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madv360.madv.sig&hl=en) – Android app source 2: [Direct from Xiaomi](http://app.xiaomi.com/details?id=com.madv360.madv&from=singlemessage): you can choose to download from Xiaomi instead of the Google Play store. Sometimes the app from Xiaomi direct download is newer. – If you want an older or newer unofficial version of the Android app, [see Michel Mendes’ archive here](http://ez-team.com/xiaomi.html).

**What kind of Micro SD card should I get? I keep getting a warning that I need to use a recommended SD card.** Due to the Mi Sphere’s high video resolution, you need to use a Micro SD card with a U3 speed rating. The faster the Micro SD speed, the longer you can record without the camera overheating. If the card is very slow, you may get dropped frames. The best Micro SD card right now is the **Sandisk Extreme Pro** ([32GB](http://amzn.to/2vfdsnm) or [64GB](http://amzn.to/2weOd92) or [128GB](http://amzn.to/2vPKQV3)), which I sometimes use but it costs more. I use the **[Samsung EVO Select** Micro SD (64GB](http://amzn.to/2fwbnB3) or [128GB](http://amzn.to/2vndKvv)) with no issues. Even if you get an Sandisk Extreme Pro, you’ll still get a warning that you need to use a recommended SD card.

**How much capacity do I need for the Micro SD card?** A one-minute video will take up approximately 300 MB (this will include the main video file and the small preview file).

**Can the camera be connected to a USB power source while recording?** Yes.

**How long can the camera record? How long can it record before overheating?** The amount of time before overheating depends on the ambient temperature, air circulation, and the speed of your memory card. In a small room with no fan and closed doors and windows (i.e., no ventilation and no air circulation), with a temperature of around 72 Fahrenheit, and using a [Samsung EVO Select micro SD card (64GB)](http://amzn.to/2vPxhFa), I was able to record 1 hour 35 minutes before the camera shutdown from overheating. Under the same conditions but plugged into a USB outlet, I recorded for 1 hour 45 minutes. It is possible to record for longer duration under better conditions.

**How do I turn on the image stabilization?** Tip 1: Turn on the camera, wait for the video LED light to turn on, then wait 5 secs for the gyro to warm up. Make sure the camera starts in vertical position, then you can begin recording.

Tip 2: Before you start recording, the camera must be upright. Then you can start recording. After you start recording, it can be any position. If you start recording while the camera is not upright, e.g. horizontal, then its starting position will become what is considered “vertical” in the video. So if it’s horizontal, it will remain horizontal.

**What are the disadvantages of stabilization?** 1. After a few minutes, the video will start to drift. [Here is how to fix the drift](https://youtu.be/rgZTEAi5d6w?t=3m15s). UPDATE: the drift has been fixed as of version 1.8.3 of the app. 2. There is a waviness in the video, like a heat wave effect. It is most noticeable in static scenes. UPDATE: this issue has been fixed as well.

**How do I turn off stabilization?**Method 1: If stitching on the Xiaomi smartphone app, load the video in the gallery, then tap on the three dots on the lower right corner, then toggle the gyro correction off before exporting. Method 2: If stitching on the Xiaomi desktop app, toggle the gyro correction off before exporting**Does the Xiaomi Mijia Mi Sphere have live streaming?** No (as of August 2017). There are rumors that it will be added.

**Is the Xiaomi Mijia Mi Sphere waterproof?**[It is water resistant, but it is not waterproof](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/can-xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-swim-waterproofing-test-life-360.html). If you want to use it underwater, please use [this waterproof case](https://goo.gl/Usxw6w).

## HOW TO STITCH RAW and GET OPTICAL FLOW STITCHING WITH THE XIAOMI MIJIA MI SPHERE

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv%201.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv%201.jpg)

Mi Sphere Converter

Yoichi Hirota, developer of Theta Converter, has created an app for optical flow stitching of the Mi Sphere photos, called Mi Sphere Converter. It can also be used for stitching RAW photos. It has smoother stitching than the Mi Sphere app, and is useful for **stitching raw files shot on version 1.8.4 of the app** and above (the raw DNG files must be converted to JPG before processing with Mi Sphere Converter). Here is a link to [actual 360 samples](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Mijia360cam/permalink/470112976717160/). The samples show smoother stitching for subjects at the stitch line even near the camera. It also has more even blending of color.

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv-2%201.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/misphere-conv-2%201.jpg)

Mi Sphere stitching can be seamless with MiSphere Converter

The alpha version of the app is [available here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hirota41.mijiaconverter&hl=en) (it will work only until December 31). The [final version of the app is available here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hirota41.misphereconverter&hl=en).

In order to use MiSphere Converter, you need to calibrate the lens. Every camera has a unique calibration. Here is a [great tutorial by Janis Bertrands](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Mijia360cam/permalink/471884616539996/) that shows the how and why of lens calibration, and how to use MiSphere Converter. Eddie Pearce has also created a [video tutorial for the lens calibration](https://www.facebook.com/100007676296094/videos/1933881436877714/) for Misphere Converter.

**How do you download the unstitched photos from the Mi Sphere for stitching on MiSphere Converter?**

There are several ways to do it. One way is to use the Micro SD card and a Micro SD card reader. A second way is to use an OTG cable. A third way is to do it wirelessly by connecting to your Mi Sphere and then using your browser to navigate to http://192.168.42.1:50422/ [Check out this tutorial by Pepe Vazquez (360 Tips & Tricks)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUNb6Fw5wgk).

1. Connect to the MiSphere via wifi. The default password is 12345678. Do not launch the Mi Sphere app.

2. Open the browser (e.g. Safari or Chrome) and in the address bar, enter 192.168.42.1:50422 (bookmark this for future reference). This will show the directory of the Mi Sphere’s Micro SD card.

3. Go to the folder you want to download photos from (it’s arranged by date) and tap to select a photo.

4. When the photo is loaded, tap on it (on iPhone, tap and hold the photo for 3 seconds — do not use Force Touch). A popup will ask if you want to save the image. Save it. The photo is now in your gallery (for iPhone, it will be under All Photos).

5. Repeat for all the photos.

MiSphere Converter is only for photos. For videos, you can use Mistika VR ([available here](https://www.sgo.es/vr-plans?affiliates=1ff1de774005f8da13f42943881c655f)) for optical flow stitching. Below is an easy tutorial for Mistika. Although I used Garmin Virb for the tutorial, the same steps apply when using Mistika with Xiaomi Mi Sphere (yes there is a Mistika preset for Mi Sphere).

## **MADVENTURE 360**

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/madv-17%201.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/madv-17%201.jpg)

Madventure 360 camera

The [Madventure 360](https://360rumors.com/2017/10/madventure-360-features-specifications-new-version-xiaomi-mi-sphere.html) is a rebranded version of the Xiaomi, repackaged for Western markets. In addition to its distinctive orange color, the Madventure comes with the dedicated selfie stick, a GoPro-style adapter plus the usual accessories for the Mi Sphere. The Madventure hardware is exactly identical to that of the Xiaomi Mi Sphere. In terms of software features, as of March 2018, they are identical, although in the future, it is possible that MADV may add new features that might not be included in the Mi Sphere app.

## **List of new features as of January 2018**

In January 2018, Xiaomi app version 1.8.8 was released, which incorporates several features (some of these features were already released in version 1.8 and subsequent versions). 1. 4K resolution. Users can now select a resolution of 3840 x 1920. However, please note that the increased resolution is interpolated therefore there is no increase in actual detail. However, if you are editing the Mi Sphere footage with other 4K camera videos, it is easier not to have to resize the Mi Sphere. 2. Bullet time effect. In the video resolution, you can select a resolution of 2048 x 512 @ 120fps which allows you to shoot a hemispherical video at 120 fps. You ca use this video mode while spinning the Xiaomi around on a selfie stick to create a bullet time effect. 3. Improved exposure controls. The main window now includes exposure controls for ISO, shutter speed, and exposure compensation. You can also control white balance. This means you can make these adjustments without going through the menus. 4. Raw DNG photo mode. Xiaomi can take photos in DNG format. The double circular fisheye file would have to be stitched using software such as the MiSphere Converter. 5. In-camera photo stitching. There is an option for in-camera stitching for photos. The stitching will be template based (and therefore will not be as smooth as with in-app stitching), but this could be a time saver for people who need to take many 360 photos. 6. Bracketing. In the main window, while in photo mode, there is an option for bracketing, which can take 3 photos up to +/- 3EV. 7. Save to SD card. In the sign in screen of the app, when you click on “More Help,” there is a new option to save files to SD card (if your phone has a Micro SD card slot). 8. Battery meter. On the main screen, there is now a visual indicator for battery life. 9. Other improvements (from version 1.8) – Intervalometer: among other things, this should enable you to take photos with a drone without using a remote control. – Slow motion video mode – GPS tagging for photos and videos – You can now use the volume buttons on your phone as the shutter – EXIF data added to photos – Screen recording feature (overcapture effect). When viewing videos, there is an option called “Record” which lets you record the screen while playing back the video in either tiny planet view or spherical view. The result is a static 16:9 video that you can save as a separate file. – Sharing to Weibo and VeeR.

3. [Here is a cheap selfie stick](https://360rumors.com/2017/06/effortless-invisibility-cheap-selfie-stick-also-invisible-360-cameras.html) that is also invisible to the Xiaomi. Available from [Gearbest](https://www.gearbest.com/photography-accessories/pp_140023.html?lkid=10383763) or [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2sPgaQX). 4. [This is the best “Lens cap” for the Xiaomi](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/heres-best-lens-cap-360-camera.html). [See why](https://360rumors.com/2017/07/heres-best-lens-cap-360-camera.html). This pouch protects from dust and scratches, and can be used for cleaning. But it does not protect from drops. You still need to use a camera case. 5. [Silicone cover and lens cap for the Xiaomi](http://amzn.to/2wVBS9r). This is a soft silicone rubber cover for the Xiaomi, and includes a silicone rubber lens cap as well. Note: I don’t know if it will have any effect on overheating but I use a similar lens cap for my Gear 360. 6. [Camera case (rapid use)](https://goo.gl/b9CsHw) – [See this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toJUvppvsW4&index=5&list=PLtGqGHDrZeFi5qPAnO0MGYJTqRxP1NXNh). This camera case is useful both as a lens cap and as a camera case. I use it with the Agent 8 microfiber pouch above.

7. [Camera case (crushproof)](https://goo.gl/1P2Jaz) – [See this demo video](https://360rumors.com/2017/06/perfect-camera-case-garmin-virb-360.html).

Faster way to transfer videos: use a Micro SD card reader. Using the Wi-Fi is slow and the camera heats up.

10. **NEW**! Dedicated Bluetooth Remote

Madv is releasing a dedicated Bluetooth remote accessory for the Mi Sphere (also works with [Madventure](https://360rumors.com/2017/12/madventure-360-features-specifications-new-version-xiaomi-mi-sphere.html)). It will be available on Amazon in April 2018, although price hasn’t been announced as of Feb. 8, 2018. Here is a video tutorial and demo:

How to pair the remote: 1. Turn on your camera. Wait for it to finish the startup. 2. Turn on the remote by pressing the shutter or power button. The remote will be in pairing mode. 3. Double-click the camera’s Wi-Fi button. You will hear a double beep. The camera and remote will pair with each other in a few seconds. 4. If the remote timed out it will say “Any key pairing”, just press any button to enter pairing mode again. And double click the Wi-Fi again.

Controls: 1. Power button (on the side) to switch between photo or video mode. 2. Shutter button to start/stop video or take a photo. 3. Hold down the settings button to bring up the settings menu. In the settings menu, press the power button to move between the options, shutter button to select the option. 4. If the camera goes to sleep from inactivity, you can remotely wake it up by pressing any button on the remote. 5. Hold down the remote’s power button to turn off both the camera and the remote.

The maximum range is 30 meters (without obstructions). Besides being a faster way to connect remotely to your camera, the remote accessory may save battery for your camera (and definitely your phone!). I will conduct further tests.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### 1. “Black Hole” or “Dracula” issue: With some Android phones

![113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/xiaomi-black-hole-issue%201.jpg](113%20b3eb8ea07a8341b49de7e6085f1a0d71/xiaomi-black-hole-issue%201.jpg)

Xiaomi Mi Sphere half black screen (black hole issue) problem and solution

In some Android phones, the preview does not show one of the lenses, resulting in a “black hole.” To fix it, upgrade the app to 1.2.1.17554 or above and toggle the option for rendering issue auto fix. When you take a photo or video, you’ll have 8 possible patches, and the app will cycle through them one by one to see which one works for your specific phone. If a patch doesn’t work, select “Try the next one.” When you find a patch that works for your phone, tap on the button “normal,” and the patch will be applied going forward. [More information about the black hole issue here](https://www.facebook.com/notes/xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-and-madv360-madventure-360-camera-users-and-fans/hot-fix-version-of-misphrercameramadventure360-android-for-blackhole-issue/514817948913329/).

### **2. HOW TO FIX BUZZING XIAOMI MIJIA MI SPHERE; How to update the firmware**

Some users have reported that their cameras are producing a clicking or buzzing noise that is most noticeable when in a quiet room. According to Madv engineers, this is a bug. The solution is to upgrade the firmware to 1.3.103.106.5.16574 or later. Check if your app makes that firmware available ([here’s how](https://360rumors.com/2017/08/xiaomi-mijia-mi-sphere-update-adds-intervalometer-features-heres-update-app-firmware.html)). If the firmware is not available via the app, you’ll have to update the firmware manually by downloading it to a Micro SD card. The firmware is [available here](http://ez-team.com/xiaomi.html).

Here’s how to upgrade the firmware via Micro SD: 1. Make sure your camera has a full charge. 2. After downloading the firmware in .zip format, rename the .zip firmware file to “MadvSysFW.zip” If files extensions are hidden in your computer, just name it “MadvSysFW”. The filename is very important. If it is not called MadvSysFW.zip, your camera could be bricked. 3. In your Micro SD card, find a directory called “update” (if there isn’t one, create that directory). Delete all the files in that directory. 4. Copy the “MadvSysFW.zip” file to the update directory on the Micro SD card. 5. Turn off the camera and insert the Micro SD card to the camera. 6. While the camera is off, hold down the Wi-Fi button and press the power button (use a short press for the power button). 7. when the Photo and Video LED lights are flashing, you can release the Wi-Fi button. The flashing lights mean that the firmware is updating. 8. When the firmware update is complete, there will be a chime and the camera will shut off. 9. Turn the camera on. It will restart one more time. Congratulations!

**3. I got my Xiaomi but it can’t take a photo or video. The LED only flashes red and blue when I take a photo or video. What should I do?**

This means your SD card needs to be formatted. To be safe, format it with the Xiaomi Mi Sphere app. In the camera mode, go to settings on the upper right corner. In the settings page, near the bottom you will see a format function.

**4. The firmware update failed. My camera has been bricked. What do I do? How do I do a factory reset?**

There are 2 steps for a factory reset: 1. Remove the Micro SD card, backup the files, format the card and reinsert it in the camera. 2. While the camera is off, press the Wi-Fi button (the middle button), then hold the power button until the two LED lights on the front of the camera start flashing.
