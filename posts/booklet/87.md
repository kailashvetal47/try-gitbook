"Everybody complains about the weather but nobody does anything about it." Likewise, everyone has an opinion about what good code looks like, but those opinions don't help you create it. This book fills that gap. It explains the *process* of writing good code, and teaches you to achieve beautifully programmed ends by way of extremely practical means.

**What It's About**

*99 Bottles of OOP* is a practical guide to writing cost-effective, maintainable, and pleasing object-oriented code.

It explores:

- Recognizing when code is "good enough"
- Getting the best value from Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Doing proper refactoring, not random "rehacktoring"
- Locating concepts buried in code
- Finding names that convey deeper meaning
- Safely altering code by following the "Flocking Rules"
- Simplifying new additions with the Open/Closed Principle
- Avoiding conditionals by obeying the Liskov Substitution Principle
- Making targeted improvements by reducing Code Smells
- Improving changeability with polymorphism
- Manufacturing role-playing objects using Factories

“If you believe that clean object design comes from black magic and guru wisdom, and you want to keep believing that, then don’t read this book. But if you’re ready to learn the simple disciplines that consistently result in robust, flexible software designs, this is the book for you.” — Avdi Grimm, Head Chef, Ruby Tapas
