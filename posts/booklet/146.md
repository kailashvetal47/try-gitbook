#  Quick tip Download an iso directly in Proxmox | ServeTheHome Forums
1. SSH into Proxmox and use your root credentials
2. cd /var/lib/vz/template/iso
3. wget [http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.04/ubuntu-15.04-server-amd64.iso](http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.04/ubuntu-15.04-server-amd64.iso)

Ubuntu 15.04 is out but instead of downloading it to my local PC I wanted to put it directly into the Proxmox ISO directory. To do that: That is it. You can use this for other ISO images found on the web also. Skips the step of having to download once, then upload. Also easy to do from one's phone.

Not sure why I didn't think of this one earlier - thanks for the tip.
